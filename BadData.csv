System.FormatException: The string 'Forrest Gump, born in the 1940s, has a limited intelligence, but an unlimited heart. By following his heart he accidentally became successful : he managed to go to college because he could run fast and was dragged into playing football, go to the Vietnam war, meet John F. Kennedy, win Ping Pong championship in China, become rich by fishing shrimps and buying stocks from the Microsoft company. Yet all that time he didn't care about that at all. He only wanted to gain the love from his childhood love, Jenny. Evidently, she appears one day at his door step, desperate for money
 Both Forrest Gump' and Being There' are ideologically identical films which are dead set at proving one point: all you need in life is luck. It's as simple as that. Both have retarded heroes that manage to become successful in life just by being at the right time at the right place. And both are great movies, although Being There' is unfortunately not nearly as popular. Forrest Gump', winner of 6 Oscars and 3 Golden Globes, is an extremely emotional roller-coaster with an tremendously naive and gentle hero that you just can't have the heart to hate. Such sequences, like the one where the 10-year old Forrest started running for the first time in his life, breaking those metal braces for his legs he had to wear because he couldn't walk properly, were so magical they sent shivers down my spine.--------------- Robert Zemeckis directs the story in a form of a vivid fairytale, not always managing to keep it logical ( would Forrest's mom really let her son go to the Vietnam war? Could Forrest really run from the east coast of the USA to the west coast? ) or consistent ( stiff ending, and come to think of it, Bill Murray would have been much better as Forrest Gump ), but still letting the positive opinion prevail, and even cleverly playing with history, stating how small often inspire the big ( like when Forrest met John Lennon in a talk show and caused him to say the words like Imagine all those people', No religion too?'. We all knew where that was going ). Many have criticized this film, calling it too pathetic, racist and even politically dubious, but I don't share that opinion. After seeing it I was left amazed, and that's the only thing that matters. Forrest Gump' is together with Schindler's List', Groundhog Day', Dances with Volwes', Rushmore' and Saving Private Ryan' one of the best films of the 90s. And yet I still can't shake that feeling away that Being There' should get more credit for the success of this film.Grade: 10/10' was not recognized as a valid DateTime.

System.FormatException: The string 'Many Tarantino fans differ on what Tarantino's best film was. Reservoir Dogs? Pulp Fiction? Inglorious Basterds? Having seen all three, the opinion I submit is the majority opinion—Pulp Fiction. But why? Pulp Fiction, in my view, represents something few movies can pull off. A completely pointless narrative made into an astonishingly good film. What is so good about a movie with no point? It's actually rather simple. Pulp Fiction doesn't use extensive special effects, or mind-bending plot, or bizarre character development. Tarantino, in fact, wrote this one pretty much by-the-book, along with co-writer Roger Avary. The plot is nothing unusual or never-before-seen. But it's the careful eye of the artist, in front of and behind the camera, that makes this film such a treat.I have watched it six times already, and each time, the movie just gets better. Each time, I see something in the background that I didn't see before. I catch something someone says, or see some minor backdrop detail that I didn't pick up on. However, this isn't why I love Pulp Fiction so much. These details are not the main thing.It's the complete package. When you step back and look at Pulp Fiction as a whole, it is nothing short of a masterpiece. Tarantino specifically chose 50 ASA film stock to make it look older than it was. This film created a beautiful look for a movie set in the sunny Hollywood Heights. The music was perfect for the crime thriller part of the feel of this movie, and the use of the Hawthorne Grill and the Chevy Nova were perfect selections to add to the classic feel of this movie, even though it's quite apparent that it's set in the modern day. Butch is driven to the hotel in a Checker cab, everything in general feels older than it really is.But what really sells it is the actors. Today, this wouldn't be a star-studded cast, it would be a diamond-studded, cast-on-platinum cast. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson make perfect hit men, and are crucial at the beginning of the film to setting up a surprising scene. Uma Thurman's small role is nevertheless appreciated, and she makes the most of her screen time not only on the part of the writers, but also because she has excellent delivery on her lines. At the end, though, I feel that Jackson is the star, even though there is truly no primary role here. His monologues are to die for in this movie.All in all, if you have not seen Pulp Fiction, change that.' was not recognized as a valid DateTime. There is an unknown word starting at index '0'.

and I like it!,"Many Tarantino fans differ on what Tarantino's best film was. Reservoir Dogs? Pulp Fiction? Inglorious Basterds? Having seen all three, the opinion I submit is the majority opinion—Pulp Fiction. But why? Pulp Fiction, in my view, represents something few movies can pull off. A completely pointless narrative made into an astonishingly good film. What is so good about a movie with no point? It's actually rather simple. Pulp Fiction doesn't use extensive special effects, or mind-bending plot, or bizarre character development. Tarantino, in fact, wrote this one pretty much by-the-book, along with co-writer Roger Avary. The plot is nothing unusual or never-before-seen. But it's the careful eye of the artist, in front of and behind the camera, that makes this film such a treat.I have watched it six times already, and each time, the movie just gets better. Each time, I see something in the background that I didn't see before. I catch something someone says, or see some minor backdrop detail that I didn't pick up on. However, this isn't why I love Pulp Fiction so much. These details are not the main thing.It's the complete package. When you step back and look at Pulp Fiction as a whole, it is nothing short of a masterpiece. Tarantino specifically chose 50 ASA film stock to make it look older than it was.

System.FormatException: The string 'The Gotham crime syndicates are afraid of the caped crusader to the point where their employees cower in the shadows at the sight of the Bat-signal and the mob bosses hold their meetings during the day. Worried that their finances are about to be seized by Lt. Gordon's strike force, (Gary Oldman once more showing his greatness in even the straightforward roles he takes when on hiatus from the crazed villains he is used to playing), they pool it all together and hand over control to an Asian corporation, naively thinking it is safe from Gotham and new DA Harvey Dent's jurisdiction. Only the demented nihilist The Joker understands that Batman has no bounds when it comes to what he is capable of. A vigilante himself, the superhero can go where he pleases and extract Lau from China, the man with every penny owned by the city's underbelly in his seemingly safe hands. This fact isn't a question of could happen, but instead one of will happen. It is the first step in The Joker's elaborate plan to take control of the city and prove to all that even the pure of heart can be and will be corruptible. Human nature is flawed and he wants to show the world just how much. Money is inconsequential; all he wants is the power and control.While first seen as a fly sticking out of a bee swarm, Batman and Gordon don't take any real heed of The Joker's threat. It is the mob they are after and, with the help of Dent, are almost to the point where they can take them down for good. But as Harvey says, it is always darker before the dawn and this crazed maniac is blotting out the sun. Devoid of morals and seriously insane'do you want to know how I got these scars?'he takes no prisoners and consistently plays with everyone on his trail. A master of the human psyche, he is always two steps ahead of Batman and Gotham's finest, pulling the strings on who is to live and who is to die. With the finding of his polar opposite in the form of Bruce Wayne's alter-ego, The Joker is ready to have fun. Knowing how Batman's one rule is the inability to kill, he pushes his buttons and places the blame of those he kills onto Wayne's consciousness. Having a man like Dent there to stand for justice, face accessible to the world and not hidden behind a mask, Wayne's guilt drives him to the edge of finally letting his identity be known. The Joker is a wild card in the poker match of life, orchestrator of anarchy, turning the world on each other and soon doesn't even need to actually do any of the killings himself. Those he toys with find themselves falling to the darkness of revenge and greed, doing his bidding without even having to be asked.No one is safe in this pitch-black world of violence and crime, almost completely shrouded in shadow once the small glint of light that seemed about to break through is snuffed out. Nolan throws conventions out the window with his plotting and willingness to take a chance on letting those we may find to be untouchable become expendable. He also has honed his action skills by giving us a bit more of a wide angle view on fights, letting them happen before our eyes and not be constructed later with quick cuts that don't meld together. And the special effects, all I can say is bravo. From the new gadgets, (sonar systems and a kickass bat-cycle whose introduction is only upstaged by its ability to flip 90 degrees by riding up a building wall), to the make-up work, (The Joker is unsettling to view without Heath Ledger's superb acting work), to the computer graphics, (not to ruin anything, but Two-Face is a sight to see), The Dark Knight pulls no punches.With solid acting all around, Christian Bale and company carry over the success from the first film without fail. However, it is the newcomers that bring the standard for comic book performances up to a level that may never be eclipsed. Aaron Eckhart is great as Dent with his pretty boy looks and affable charm. Unable to be bullied or scared, Eckhart embodies the good that Gotham has in its future and the subtle hinting to the darkness always hiding behind the façade of someone that pure of heart. He himself said it best, 'you either die the hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.' Foreshadowing at its best.But of course, the true amazement is with Ledger's Joker. When cast, many had their doubts, yet I remember always standing by the choice, knowing he could hit it out of the park if given the chance. Wow, this is the best villain ever put to screen. His vocal work and laugh are chilling and the facial ticks and licking of the lips just show the detail Ledger put in. The back-and-forths between him and Bale are always intriguing and exciting as the two powerhouses just put on a clinic and how about the introduction to his character at the start robbing the bank, what an entrance. The only part of this film that left me sad was the fact that we won't be able to see Ledger reprise the role in the next installment. Kudos to Nolan for already saying that they will not recast; it is an honor to the job Heath did and to the audience so as not to pull a switch, ruining the character and movie because no one could ever even attempt to match the craft that went into the role here. A fantastic performance in a fantastic film

Devoid of morals and seriously insane'do you want to know how I got these scars?'he takes no prisoners and consistently plays with everyone on his trail. A master of the human psyche, he is always two steps ahead of Batman and Gotham's finest, pulling the strings on who is to live and who is to die. With the finding of his polar opposite in the form of Bruce Wayne's alter-ego, The Joker is ready to have fun. Knowing how Batman's one rule is the inability to kill, he pushes his buttons and places the blame of those he kills onto Wayne's consciousness. Having a man like Dent there to stand for justice, face accessible to the world and not hidden behind a mask, Wayne's guilt drives him to the edge of finally letting his identity be known. The Joker is a wild card in the poker match of life, orchestrator of anarchy, turning the world on each other and soon doesn't even need to actually do any of the killings himself. Those he toys with find themselves falling to the darkness of revenge and greed, doing his bidding without even having to be asked.No one is safe in this pitch-black world of violence and crime, almost completely shrouded in shadow once the small glint of light that seemed about to break through is snuffed out. Nolan throws conventions out the window with his plotting and willingness to take a chance on letting those we may find to be untouchable become expendable. He also has honed his action skills by giving us a bit more of a wide angle view on fights, letting them happen before our eyes and not be constructed later with quick cuts that don't meld together. And the special effects, all I can say is bravo. From the new gadgets, (sonar systems and a kickass bat-cycle whose introduction is only upstaged by its ability to flip 90 degrees by riding up a building wall), to the make-up work, (The Joker is unsettling to view without Heath Ledger's superb acting work), to the computer graphics, (not to ruin anything, but Two-Face is a sight to see), The Dark Knight pulls no punches.With solid acting all around, Christian Bale and company carry over the success from the first film without fail. However, it is the newcomers that bring the standard for comic book performances up to a level that may never be eclipsed. Aaron Eckhart is great as Dent with his pretty boy looks and affable charm. Unable to be bullied or scared, Eckhart embodies the good that Gotham has in its future and the subtle hinting to the darkness always hiding behind the façade of someone that pure of heart. He himself said it best, 'you either die the hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.' Foreshadowing at its best.But of course, the true amazement is with Ledger's Joker. When cast, many had their doubts, yet I remember always standing by the choice, knowing he could hit it out of the park if given the chance. Wow, this is the best villain ever put to screen. His vocal work and laugh are chilling and the facial ticks and licking of the lips just show the detail Ledger put in. The back-and-forths between him and Bale are always intriguing and exciting as the two powerhouses just put on a clinic and how about the introduction to his character at the start robbing the bank, what an entrance. The only part of this film that left me sad was the fact that we won't be able to see Ledger reprise the role in the next installment. Kudos to Nolan for already saying that they will not recast; it is an honor to the job Heath did and to the audience so as not to pull a switch, ruining the character and movie because no one could ever even attempt to match the craft that went into the role here. A fantastic performance in a fantastic film

The film is a perfect example of craftsmanship which showcases the 'perfect' handover from comics to the big screen. The sublime touch, with which a cartoon serial-killer with a slithery reptilian tongue is not only bought to life but epitomized for life, is unmatched. If 'Batman Begins' belonged to the super hero this master piece belonged to the anti – hero. The legend - Heath Ledger has truly immortalized 'The Joker' with the performance of a lifetime
 There was a tremendous amount of expectation form the film especially post the 'batman begins' saga and the film was hyped in the truest of senses with viral to theatrical trailers being bombarded on the audience world over.. But the movie actually surpassed the hype and how!!
 there hasn't been any instance of such 'over hyped' movie later being felt like 'just promoted' after watching. Nolan, thank you for the 2.5 hours (yes it's that long but you crave for more when it ends!!) for this piece of art which makes 'movie going' all the more meaningfulThere is no 'great' story as a 'backbone' apart from the fact that the Batman now has to face his most cunning and psychotic enemy, someone with no real motives...The Joker. But the real thing to talk about is the actors - Christian Bale has done a tremendous job as our beloved Caped Crusader, with him already blowing everyone else out of water with 'Batman Begins.' Bruce Wayne who fought self fears to be a super hero ultimately has the 'vulnerable' weak spot (which is his dual life balance - whether he is a wealthy businessman who fights crime in a gadget-riddled suit or just a normal man who is sick of all the scum in Gotham City) is exploited by the menacing - cunning - calculated 'Joker' making us emphasize with Bale's 'flawed hero'more than any of the other actors. If there ever was an 'excellent' Batman --- this is it. The 'wrong' is 'rightly' played with his character here. Heath Ledger was not only the best, but is now the greatest superhero film villain ever. His performance is truly terrifying, chilling, brilliant etc
 etc.... Every scene he is in - is stolen. (A well deserved Oscar
) Even the 'side' actors cannot be forgotten - Harvey Dent (and later Two Face) he is very powerful, Rachel Dawes (Maggie) is much better than Katie Holmes, Michael Caine can do nothing wrong, Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox and Gary Oldman's rejuvenated Lt. James Gordon..The score sets the mood in every scene, giving an 'epic' tone. The 'dark' cinematography and screenplay are well complemented with state of the art action sequences (this was a drastic improvement over the 'batman begins' version). The dialogue is very well 'crafted'. In short – a perfect combo for a masterpiece and Nolan has delivered yet again flawlessly Usually sequels don't turn out to be better than the original but The Dark Knight is one of those rare sequels that surpassed the original like The Godfather and terminator 2. 10/10 definitely (it does bring a 'smile' on your face) 
 It's a honor that film was made in my lifetime
PS: If you look at the votes count; there are over 10K people who have given a rating of '1' for this movie.. may be they are such people who after seeing 'Cleopatra' say that she is 'ugly' because of her 'IQ' (guys you need rehab.. no seriously..)' was not recognized as a valid DateTime.

System.FormatException: The string 'Believe the hype
This IS the Movie of 2008. No question about it. Maybe even one of THE best movies of all time. In fact, it's not just the movie of the year, The Dark Knight is now a milestone in cinema history. It will change how future summer blockbusters will be made.Every Hollywood film maker in the world should now have this mother of a movie in the back of their minds when creating their new movie. Trying to work out what on earth Christopher Nolan did to make not only a fantastic summer blockbuster, but a brilliantly written, brilliantly acted and brilliantly intelligent masterpiece.With The Dark Knight, it's hard to decide where to begin explaining why it's so amazing and why it's one of the finest films ever made. But, we've got to start somewhere so I'll start with my favourite element of the movie: The Joker.The Joker is not only now my favourite movie villain of all time, but he's also now one of my favourite movie characters of all time, up there with Arnie's T-800 and Weaving's Agent Smith. The character is all what you would want from a movie villain. He's scary, DISTURBINGLY scary, he's funny, DISTURBINGLY funny, intelligent and very witty. But what is also very intriguing and very important is that he has no motive. He doesn't want money, He doesn't want revenge. All he wants, in the words of Michael Caine, is to 'Watch the world burn', and he doesn't care who he hurts or what he does to accomplish his goal. There's just SO much more to talk about with the Joker, i.e. the make-up, the costume, the dialogue and his memorable scenes that you could fill an entire page with detail, but I need to talk about everything else as well so unfortunately I should move on. One last thing though about the Joker. I think it's a massive shame that the actor portraying the Joker, Heath Ledger, died shortly after filming, because I'm sure he would had had a fantastic career ahead of him and is sure to win Best Actor at the next Oscars.Lets move on to Batman himself. The character of Bruce Wayne and Batman are pretty much the same as they were in Begins, only they've obviously learnt a lot over the time that has past. With the character of Batman, it's great to see that he's still developing his suit and gadgets and is in progression of fighting crime, not just Batman fighting a super villain over a clean city. His new suit is awesome, his Batmobile looks better than ever and the Batpod is just incredible.As you may know, The Dark Knight has two villains: Joker and Two-Face. When I first heard that they were having two villains, I immediately assumed that Two-Face's reveal would be left until the end of the movie and that we would see him as the central villain in the third film, similar to how Begins ended with the Joker card. How wrong was I! Two-Face, or Harvey Dent, is a very important character throughout the entire film and is portrayed brilliantly by Aaron Eckhart. The face make-up and CGI used to create the 'Two-Face' are phenomenal and the whole use of the two headed coin flipping is brilliant. It's hard to believe that Tommy Lee Jones played the same character in Batman Forever as Eckhart's portrayal is a massive contrast! I'm really glad Nolan didn't leave his reveal for the end, as I don't believe the character could match up to the Joker in a third film and don't think he could hold the villain role on his own.There are so many great and different characters in The Dark Knight it's impossible to go into detail about every one, but here is a quick run down of all the other notable characters. Maggie Gyllenhaal, who portrays Rachel Dawes, is probably the weakest actress and character in the film. She isn't awful, but compared to the rest of the cast she is the weakest. Michael Caine gives a great and funny performance again as Alfred, Morgan Freeman does what he does best as Lucius and Gary Oldman returns as Gordon, the only clean cop in Gotham.There are so many memorable scenes in the film, but a few that are definitely worth mentioning are the opening bank scene, the Batmobile/Batpod chase, Two-face's burn, reveal and coin tossing, every scene involving the Joker (especially the hospital sequence) and the final action sequence.After seeing a film like this, it's hard to believe that anything I will see now will surpass this. The film has surpassed all expectations and has done what most sequels fail to do frequently: Surpass the original. Not only does it surpass it, but it also introduces an entirely different style of film.The only thing left to think about now is what is in store for the third in Nolan's Bat Trilogy? What style of film will we see? What new villains will we see? The Riddler? Penguin? Catwoman? One can only speculate for now, but one thing is for sure, and that is that it's going to take something extremely special to surpass a sequel that has been ranked high with classics like The Godfather and The Shawshank Redemption.Overall, The Dark Knight is one of the finest films ever made and do not let any one tell you any different until you have witnessed this masterpiece for yourself at the theatre. A MUST SEE movie for everyone!' was not recognized as a valid DateTime. There is an unknown word starting at index '0'.

System.FormatException: The string 'Christopher Nolan must be one of the most admired men in the film industry of late. Having been handed a superhero franchise crumbling under its own campiness and trusted with the task of revamping it, adding a firm undercurrent of complexity without sacrificing the inherent enjoyment associated with a man dressing as a bat battling the criminal underworld, Nolan thrived upon the challenge, his Batman Begins providing a new height in the genre and one of the most acclaimed films of the year. And as seemingly impossible as it may have seemed to top his first effort, Nolan appears to have tapped into even more film-making genius, his peerless imagination, courage and unwavering control over every facet of his production making The Dark Knight a seamless, dazzlingly complex sequel to an already essentially flawless first effort - it is near impossible to envision the film being any stronger.Though the film embraces similar themes and plays to all the strengths of the genre, in the end the film proves a 'comic book movie' essentially in name only, as it feels as if Nolan has seamlessly melded several films into one, the tone varying from ultra realistic crime dramas (such as Nolan's inspiration, Michael Mann's Heat) to using the template of the traditional superhero/supervillain conflict as a parable of good, evil and the constant ambiguity and overlap between. In a particularly chilling passage, the Joker disturbingly dissects the effects of Batman and himself on Gotham city and how the friction between 'an unstoppable force and an immovable object', or Batman's unwavering dedication to justice counterbalancing the Joker's obsession with chaos and disarray simply leads to everlasting conflict. 'I feel like we could do this forever', the Joker wryly states, and with such chilling, exhilarating and fiendishly complex results, the possibility is mouth-watering indeed.In fact, if one was to extract any form of complaint from such a complex marvel of a film it would be that through the film's consistent breakneck pace and flurry of new plot points and story arcs, the audience is somewhat deprived of the chance to savour some of the film's elements, to take a moment to drink in the all around mastery, from the quiet character moments to the jaw dropping stunts or flooring performances. But there can be little doubt that this is fully Nolan's intent, as The Dark Knight proves an entirely different animal than its predecessor: less about characters (though their development in the simply superb screenplay by Nolan and his brother Jonathan is near flawless) than broad statements, and the lack of quiet, reflective moments simply furthering the chaotic, uncertain feel of the story. However, despite the vast, epic array of content, never does it feel like Nolan has bitten off more than he can chew, but rather than the viewer is challenged to keep up with his immensity of vision.However, those expecting a light-hearted, carefree action romp will find themselves somewhat taken aback, as the film is aptly titled, 'dark' being the operative word. Never before has a comic book film boasted a tone of such crushing realism and devastating, visceral wrenching of emotions. Yet despite the absence of outright bombastic fun, never does the question 'why so serious?' emerge, as The Dark Knight could never have been anything but, yet never proves overly morose to the point of preventing entertainment. Similarly, those fearing the genre becoming overly cerebral need not fear the action frontier being sacrificed, as Nolan somehow manages to again up the ante on his first effort's already breathless action sequences, providing enough explosions and brief but ferociously intense combat scenes to sate any action enthusiast without sacrificing an ounce of complexity. The sweeping, sumptuous cinematography and soaring score by two of modern cinema's finest composers, Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard completes the sublime package, making for a technically savoury masterpiece.Christian Bale once again gives a remarkable performance, breathing consistently credible life into each of the title character's dual identities, providing a wistful desperation for a Bruce Wayne tantalised by the prospect of abandoning Batman while his alter ego is needed more than ever by his crumbling city. However, despite Bale's powerhouse lead there can be no doubt that the film's primary selling point is the flat out terrifying yet mesmerizing performance by the tragically late Heath Ledger. His anarchistic Joker unquestionably steals the show (no easy feat), flipping between darkly hilarious and chilling while remaining a consistently fascinating and compelling creation - a frighteningly real antagonist for the ages, and easily one of the most visibly unsettling and powerful performances in decades. Aaron Eckhart is similarly superb as Harvey Dent, Gotham's new tenaciously dedicated district attorney, and his inevitable fall from earnest grace is truly affecting, with Eckhart perfectly essaying the shift from charismatic to horrifying. Michael Caine offers a perfect dose of wry humour and inspiration as Wayne's trusted butler Alfred, and Gary Oldman gives a rousingly sympathetic performance as fiercely honest cop Jim Gordon, with Oldman giving one of the most credible heroic performance in recent memory. Morgan Freeman remains pure class as Wayne's CEO and Batman's secret outfitter, and Maggie Gyllenhaal proves a far superior replacement to Katie Holmes, adding a witty spark to an otherwise standard love interest role.Never once patronising its audience, The Dark Knight proves easily the most mature, staggeringly intelligent, insightful, breathless and pitch black comic book adaptation to grace the screen in recent memory, and arguably ever. Indeed, the Joker's declaration of Batman's effect on Gotham's criminals proves prophetic and parallels the effect of the film itself on its medium - there can be little doubt that The Dark Knight has changed the face of what can be expected out of a comic book movie, dispelling critical scorn and rivalling any 'serious film' in terms of complexity and film-making mastery. Never again will the face of comic book movies be the same - 'there's no going back'.-10/10' was not recognized as a valid DateTime. There is an unknown word starting at index '0'.

However, despite the vast, epic array of content, never does it feel like Nolan has bitten off more than he can chew, but rather than the viewer is challenged to keep up with his immensity of vision.However, those expecting a light-hearted, carefree action romp will find themselves somewhat taken aback, as the film is aptly titled, 'dark' being the operative word. Never before has a comic book film boasted a tone of such crushing realism and devastating, visceral wrenching of emotions. Yet despite the absence of outright bombastic fun, never does the question 'why so serious?' emerge, as The Dark Knight could never have been anything but, yet never proves overly morose to the point of preventing entertainment. Similarly, those fearing the genre becoming overly cerebral need not fear the action frontier being sacrificed, as Nolan somehow manages to again up the ante on his first effort's already breathless action sequences, providing enough explosions and brief but ferociously intense combat scenes to sate any action enthusiast without sacrificing an ounce of complexity. The sweeping, sumptuous cinematography and soaring score by two of modern cinema's finest composers, Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard completes the sublime package, making for a technically savoury masterpiece.Christian Bale once again gives a remarkable performance, breathing consistently credible life into each of the title character's dual identities, providing a wistful desperation for a Bruce Wayne tantalised by the prospect of abandoning Batman while his alter ego is needed more than ever by his crumbling city. However, despite Bale's powerhouse lead there can be no doubt that the film's primary selling point is the flat out terrifying yet mesmerizing performance by the tragically late Heath Ledger. His anarchistic Joker unquestionably steals the show (no easy feat), flipping between darkly hilarious and chilling while remaining a consistently fascinating and compelling creation - a frighteningly real antagonist for the ages, and easily one of the most visibly unsettling and powerful performances in decades. Aaron Eckhart is similarly superb as Harvey Dent, Gotham's new tenaciously dedicated district attorney, and his inevitable fall from earnest grace is truly affecting, with Eckhart perfectly essaying the shift from charismatic to horrifying. Michael Caine offers a perfect dose of wry humour and inspiration as Wayne's trusted butler Alfred, and Gary Oldman gives a rousingly sympathetic performance as fiercely honest cop Jim Gordon, with Oldman giving one of the most credible heroic performance in recent memory. Morgan Freeman remains pure class as Wayne's CEO and Batman's secret outfitter, and Maggie Gyllenhaal proves a far superior replacement to Katie Holmes, adding a witty spark to an otherwise standard love interest role.Never once patronising its audience, The Dark Knight proves easily the most mature, staggeringly intelligent, insightful, breathless and pitch black comic book adaptation to grace the screen in recent memory, and arguably ever. Indeed, the Joker's declaration of Batman's effect on Gotham's criminals proves prophetic and parallels the effect of the film itself on its medium - there can be little doubt that The Dark Knight has changed the face of what can be expected out of a comic book movie, dispelling critical scorn and rivalling any 'serious film' in terms of complexity and film-making mastery. Never again will the face of comic book movies be the same - 'there's no going back'.-10/10"

System.FormatException: The string 'Those of us with the unmitigated gall to still love Marvel Studios movies bear a perennial cross: everyone else bemoaning their superhero ennui. How they've had enough of self-important, solemn, formulaic superhero films, with their aimless CGI- drenched climaxes, paint-by-numbers villains, and clumsy scaffolding to sell tickets to future movies. 'All fair,' I respond, as we wait to pre-order our Black Panther tickets. Still, you know what they say about squeaky wheels - Disney execs listen to them, apparently. And lo, there was balance in the Force er Thor-ce? And Ragnarok is its puzzling Skywalker. On one hand, its unfettered comedic whimsy and synth-soaked Flash Gordon pastiche feel like a profound victory for the forces of fun. And yet, there's something perennially off - an indulgence in its kookiness that goes beyond cheeky and strays perilously close to contemptuous at times. Granted, it's perversely appropriate that a blockbuster titled after the apocalyptic eradication of Asgard and the Gods work to dismantle the established tone and mythos of Thor so gleefully. Still, as giddily enjoyable as this apocalypse is, there's still an inescapable sense of the baby being thrown out with the Asgardian bathwater. Thor - a literal 'super-god' - has always been tough to sell. Even Kenneth Branagh, hired for his Shakespearian credentials, subjected ol' Goldilocks to slapstick and punchlines galore (and a meowing Kat Dennings) in his first cinematic outing to keep him accessible. In this regard, the quirky, charming Taika Waititi is an unorthodox but inspired directorial choice, and he musters up more colour, zippiness, and breezy humour that Thor's previous four appearances combined. No gag, be it witty or scatological, is too small for Waititi, and it's rare for his leads to go more than a few minutes without being subjected to some kind of amusing physical comedy indignation (Hiddleston's Loki, of all people, steals the film's biggest laugh and pratfall in one fell swoop). And, varying degrees of silliness or not, the film is uproariously funny from opening to closing shot. What doesn't work as well is the film's comparative lack of consequence otherwise. Well-deserved zany tonal shift or not, Ragnarok is, literally, about the end of the world. And, although proceedings need not be as dark as, er, The Dark World, it is fairly disconcerting-nigh-disrespectful to have a film involving genocide, slavery, the inglorious death of the entirety of Thor's family(!!!), subplots unpacking Asgardian war-crimes and refugees (intriguing but under-explored), and, y'know, the whole end of days thing, be treated with such glib indifference by Waititi's customary impassive deadpan. Characters factually state that they are upset about their tribulations, but it seldom resonates, as Waititi, uncharacteristically, deprives them of the gently emotional character check-ins that elevate his more strictly comedic fare - Viago the vampire pining like a puppy at the window of his aging crush; Ricky Baker's crude, pyromaniac haiku betraying a lifetime of loneliness. Similarly, the film's editing is almost teasingly clumsy, careening between locations and disparate plot points (including a Benedict Cumberbatch cameo as riotously enjoyable as it is transparently superfluous) with a smirking nonchalance. If Waititi's intent was to have his cake and eat it too - taking the p*ss out of Thor while still delivering a straightforward Thor romp - he heartily delivers on the former, but too often at the behest of the latter. Still, as the Grandmaster might chortle, you can debate academic semantics all day, but we all know why we're really here. And, in terms of exhilarating spectacle, Waititi kicks it out of the gladiatorial arena. From fire demons and subterranean dragons, to the impressively nuanced emotions of a certain jolly green giant, Ragnarok boasts some of the most exceptionally realized visual effects in a Marvel film, and Waititi draws a clever contrast between the pristine, techno- mythology panoramas of Asgard (which we finally see, beyond throne room and rainbow bridge!), and the junky, Jack Kirby cubism of Sakaar. Similarly, the film's combat, both in and out of the arena, is fast, furious, and engrossing, with operatically surreal touches - including a showdown between Hela's rippling waves of knives, spaceship lasers, a giant wolf, and two machine guns - keeping proceedings fun and fresh.Chris Hemsworth has proved himself more than reliably adept at flexing comedic muscles in tandem with biceps. Nonetheless, this Thor is a few too many 'Bros' and mugging punchlines away from his past self to fully invest in to the extent we know we can and should. Tom Hiddleston, conversely, continues to find new, compelling wrinkles in Loki - both comedic, as a begrudging whipping boy, and in quiet, crestfallen, recognition of his perennial self-sabotaging his secret aspirations of heroism. Mark Ruffalo is pristinely deadpan without overstaying his welcome, while playing his warring Hulk/Banner character beats of indignant, cavernous loneliness for all their worth. Cate Blanchett preens with masterful predatory menace, but feels almost criminally wasted as yet another frustratingly underdeveloped Marvel foe. Thankfully, Tessa Thompson is coolness personified as the grimly alcoholic Valkyrie, even if Karl Urban's Skurge feels a touch too goofy and hangdog, given his ferocious comic referent. That said, if Ragnarok unleashes one abiding gift unto the world, it's the most unapologetically unhinged Jeff Goldblum since he first growled like a dinosaur back in '93. Every microsecond of Grandmaster weirdness is a rainbow rose of enigmatic wisdom. Thor: Ragnarok stands as a curious, slight overcompensation from a company fighting to appease a virtually built-in audience. Still, as a comedy first, superhero film second, it's an uproariously entertaining ride, albeit one that may leave comic purists wishing Waititi could have dialled down the silly or dialled up the emotion 20% for optimum Odinson. Still, as ThorFour may never grace cinemas, it's sufficient to crank the Led Zeppelin, and ride into the intergalactic sunset with him getting to enjoy himself for once. Excessively nitpicking a swan song so well-deserved would be 'just ugh the worst.' -7.5/10' was not recognized as a valid DateTime. There is an unknown word starting at index '0'.

From fire demons and subterranean dragons, to the impressively nuanced emotions of a certain jolly green giant, Ragnarok boasts some of the most exceptionally realized visual effects in a Marvel film, and Waititi draws a clever contrast between the pristine, techno- mythology panoramas of Asgard (which we finally see, beyond throne room and rainbow bridge!), and the junky, Jack Kirby cubism of Sakaar. Similarly, the film's combat, both in and out of the arena, is fast, furious, and engrossing, with operatically surreal touches - including a showdown between Hela's rippling waves of knives, spaceship lasers, a giant wolf, and two machine guns - keeping proceedings fun and fresh.Chris Hemsworth has proved himself more than reliably adept at flexing comedic muscles in tandem with biceps. Nonetheless, this Thor is a few too many 'Bros' and mugging punchlines away from his past self to fully invest in to the extent we know we can and should. Tom Hiddleston, conversely, continues to find new, compelling wrinkles in Loki - both comedic, as a begrudging whipping boy, and in quiet, crestfallen, recognition of his perennial self-sabotaging his secret aspirations of heroism. Mark Ruffalo is pristinely deadpan without overstaying his welcome, while playing his warring Hulk/Banner character beats of indignant, cavernous loneliness for all their worth. Cate Blanchett preens with masterful predatory menace, but feels almost criminally wasted as yet another frustratingly underdeveloped Marvel foe. Thankfully, Tessa Thompson is coolness personified as the grimly alcoholic Valkyrie, even if Karl Urban's Skurge feels a touch too goofy and hangdog, given his ferocious comic referent. That said, if Ragnarok unleashes one abiding gift unto the world, it's the most unapologetically unhinged Jeff Goldblum since he first growled like a dinosaur back in '93. Every microsecond of Grandmaster weirdness is a rainbow rose of enigmatic wisdom. Thor: Ragnarok stands as a curious, slight overcompensation from a company fighting to appease a virtually built-in audience. Still, as a comedy first, superhero film second, it's an uproariously entertaining ride, albeit one that may leave comic purists wishing Waititi could have dialled down the silly or dialled up the emotion 20% for optimum Odinson. Still, as ThorFour may never grace cinemas, it's sufficient to crank the Led Zeppelin, and ride into the intergalactic sunset with him getting to enjoy himself for once. Excessively nitpicking a swan song so well-deserved would be 'just ugh the worst.' -7.5/10"
