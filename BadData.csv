It's waste three hours film and bad storyline (not make any sense and confused). I don't understand why people likes it, I didn't cry or laugh but felt sleepy.Here are the few things that I don't like the movie1. Too many superheroes against baby Thanos.2. Timeline - That is cheating and all the superheroes stills lose.3. It's not an action film, it more likes drama/sci-fi film.4. Natasha (black widow) didn't have to die, she should uses Red skull.5. Thor and Hulk are lazy and they are no need to be in the film and possibly the other superheroes.6. What is Rocket doing? Why did he need to travel in time?7. Ironman didn't have to put the glove on but use the remote control to snap the finger.I can't think of what else to write here but if you want to watch this, it's better to wait for rental dvd/digital to save your money."

Her presence on screen makes you want to walk out. Not to mention the film is already filled to the brim with unncessary huge number of "strong" female characters to the point its absurd. And not cool, awesome strong female characters like Rene Russo's character, whom you believe is a bada5s and has depth.So female Jar Jar aside (an insult to Jar Jar actually), the movie, the first half, is pretty darn good, with many great comical moments especially. Second half and especially the last third, it slows down and starts becoming the formulaic and typical hollywood film, full of empty fighting, streched out beyond all sensible constraints. The ending is also not very insipiring or clever.Also at times it suffers from some quite bad writing. Like when Thor presents Valkyrie with Asgard as if it is this great gift to her. Remember Asgard, a majestic, wonderful city on a half waterfall, half clouds, with a rainbow and beautiful weather every day.Asgard,that is NOW a small sh1thole of a fishing village, cold and damp 11 months out of the year, with pollution and just an overall miserable life. Who the F would want to be a queen of that ?Anyway I dont see why it has such a high score, it definitely doesnt deserve it. Its not bad but its nothing special either with too many noticeable distractions that annoy you."

But they don't fit together well.The biggest question left by this trilogy is --- where was Captain Marvel in Infinity War? She is the most powerful and capable of all the Avengers. She says in Endgame the Universe is a big place. And everybody doesn't have The Avengers to take care of them. Well? How was she helping anybody in the Universe if she allows Thanos to wipe out half the Universe with the snap of his fingers? I wonder how the original comic books answered this question.Well, I guess we aren't supposed to take these stories too seriously. It's all make believe anyway."

1,24-Apr-19,duoasf,372,792,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"Disappointingly Mediocre","I want to begin by saying that had this been a standalone movie I would have probably given it a 4 or 5, but for this particular movie, the movie of the decade, the big conclusion everything was leading up to, mediocre-ness is worse than complete failure. We were promised a masterpiece and we received something that what so-so at best.I'll break down what I think went wrong, so spoilers ahead:The biggest issue with this movie is the ever-paradoxical use of time travel. Unless you are making a silly comedy like "Back to the Future" it always messes with continuity and no matter how well you try to explain that the canon reality does not just collapse under the paradox, it is always going to feel like the lazy way out, and so it did in this one. Steve deciding to go rogue back to the 40s, thus ignoring all the character development he went through and irreparably messing with every timeline is not exactly the extremely satisfying closure we were promised in interviews with directors and actors. Overall I suppose the expectations were just so high that nothing could have lived up to it, but with the amounts of money and the access to great creators Marvel has I really would have expected something else- something as creative and mind-blowing as they promised instead of the honestly mediocre at best time-travel flick we got. Messing with timelines and essentially de-canonizing large chunks of the MCU just was not what I was hoping for.Another thing I had a problem with is that this movie was supposed to perfectly conclude every character's arc so far. We were promised a suitable ending of some journeys and at least a crucial point in everyone else's. Instead, Black Widow was killed without ever even allowing her to develop a character. Thor, who could have been the ideal king of Asgard was turned into a fatphobic joke by equating his chubbiness with sloppiness (personally, I liked his new look. Thor looked rather like a man who is strong from physical labour than planned workouts and diet plans, but the way they dressed him in dirty clothes, made him lazy and greasy is just so terrible), while the lessons he learned in Ragnarok and the sacrifices he made did not seem to have any effect at all; the loyalty he felt to his people completely disappeared. Iron Man was ripped of his peaceful retirement, where for the first time he was allowed to try to heal, just because someone had to die dramatically.Don't misunderstand me, I am not bitter that they killed off beloved characters, in fact I understand that it had to happen, however I would have loved to see them take the characters' arcs into account. In my opinion, Steve should have died because he has no place in either the future or the past, and his mission is completed. Tony, on the other hand, should have lived because he finally made an effort to heal and overcome his trauma. I don't mean to suggest that one or another character should or should not have died, I only think I might have been able to accept the way things turned out if there was a reasonable plot leading up to it that made their death a logical conclusion. The Marvel movies are fictional and everyone who goes to watch them is very aware of the fact that there is a team of writers and creators who crafted everyone's arc and worked on it for a long time. I would have appreciated to watch the outcome reflect the amount of work and time I am sure many people put into this project.Ultimately I have to admit that the messages we get to take away from this film are what really made me sad: People with trauma don't deserve to heal, people's actions and experiences have seemingly no consequences, and friendship and found family mean nothing against the ideal of a romantic relationship.This is a very long movie and so there are many more things I could address, for example the "Hail Hydra" scene, Steve wielding Mjolnir, how similar this movie was to the last one, Loki's unexplained disappearance in the past timeline, the cheap attempt of making up for the lack of lgbt heroes by showing a mlm extra in one scene, the list goes on. But all those things seem somehow related to the major issues I addressed earlier. Perhaps the hype was too big, perhaps the team did get lazy and rested on the success of the franchise or perhaps it is just me expecting too much from a superhero movie.Regardless, if you loved this movie, I see your point, it is in many ways what we were expecting, but what I was hoping for was something new, something revolutionary that would surprise and amaze me. Maybe in another ten or twenty years we will get that movie I thought this was going to be, but I am afraid that by then I will not be interested anymore."

Sign in to vote.,"Did entertain, not wow though","At the end of this overlong movie, I was okay with the series ending.I found it rather bland. A three-hour-wake to the series. I wasn't really involved in any of it. The plot was not what I had expected, and even if I found the time travel idea nice, what they did with it was nah. And don't you EVER slag Back To The Future.Endgame started with and continued to have too little action, too little FUN, too much 'oh woe is me', too little time travel explained, too little plot, too slow.It was one looooong wake, to the series, to Iron-Man, maybe to Stan. Make love not war! A send-off. With lots of male depression. Yawn. At times I felt I was watching a Hallmark movie.Captain Marvel was just an Iron-Man retriever. lolEverything was well-acted, yes. But even though I do appreciate slow play and character studies, it seemed wrong in this final film. Jeez. Doom and Gloom. Sitting around moping, or killing baddies all over the world, or starting a self-help group....Yawn. Really. That's what they come up with?? Was it supposed to be funny? Was it supposed to be poignant?Well it wasn't. The survivors of The Snap did erect a huge, spotless, visited memorial, but they cannot collect the trash? Like people would stop caring. Silly. People die every day, there is tragedy around us, and people deal with it. That's what people do. Yes, you can off yourself or go into depression, but I am convinced the majority would 'make the best of it' - adapt, carry on.You know, after GOT 08/03 last Monday this one was a borefest. That one had horrible picture quality, but much more drama with less words."

Sign in to vote.,"Thanks for the memories","For those who are not entirely familiar with the Marvel Universe as offered in The Avengers series, Phase 1 introduces some of the Avengers with their own separate movies, culminating in their first assignment together. Phase 2 continues the development, adds more members and moves on to their second assignment. Phase 3 starts with a twist seeing the members pitched against one another in two groups and, towards the end, brings up their most formidable opponent by far.More specifically, Phase 1 comprises 6 movies starting with "Ironman" (2008), then introduces The Hulk (Edward Norton at the time), Thor and Captain America, culminating in "The Avengers" (2012) which shows these four teaming up with Black Widow and Hawkeye for the initial lineup.Phase 2, commencing with "Iron Man 3" (2013), uses another 6 movies to trace the evolution of the Avengers. "Avengers: Age of Ultron" (2015) detailing their second assignment adds to the team two major players, Scarlet Witch and Vision. Another entirely different team is also introduced in "Guardians of the Galaxy" although their path has not yet converged with that of the original Avengers in this Phase. "Ant-man" (2015), with his own stand-alone movie, brings up the rear of this Phase.Phases 3, with a total of 11 movies, starts with "Captain America: Civil War" (2016), which has been given the nicknamed "Avengers 2.5". The Avengers are divided into two groups, under Iron Man and Captain America, supporting and opposing, respectively, government supervision. While the Hulk and Thor are nowhere to be seen, newcomers brought in are Spider-man and Black Panther, plus a few others who have already appeared before (Ant-man, Falcon, War Machine, Winter Soldier). Then, more blanks are filled in. A new character, Dr. Strange, is introduced via his own stand-alone. Also in their own stand-alone movies are Spider-man and Black Panther, introduced belatedly. The whereabouts of Thor and the Hulk is revealed via another sequel of the former's franchise, in which another new character Valkyrie is introduced.Then comes the long awaited "Avengers: Infinity War", #8 in Phase 3 (and #20 in the entire "Infinite Saga"). The ultimate villain Thanos, menacingly lurking behind hitherto, comes to the forefront. Everybody mentioned above in the Avengers community join force, including the convergence with Guardians of the Galaxy whose key character Gamora is Thanos's alienated adopted daughter. Well, almost everybody. Ant-man and Hawkeye are not there.The devastating conclusion of Infinity War sees Thanos, at a snap of his finger, literally, kills off half the world's population, completely at random. That of course includes members of The Avengers, also entirely at random. Following that are two blank-filling movies. "Ant-man and the Wasp" explains why it was absent and introduces yet another new superhero The Wasp. Completing the assembly comes "Captain Marvel", hitherto unheard of, until the post-credit of Infinity War when Nick Fury, just before disintegration, sends her an S.O.S. message, as the court of last appeal.In the trailer of "Avengers: Endgame", when one of the Avengers, not addressing anybody in particular, says "Why would it be different from before?" Without missing a beat Captain Marvel replies "Before, you didn't have me." You will see this within the opening minutes of Endgame.So, where is my user review? There is so much to say. To non-fans, that wouldn't mean a lot. To hard-core fans who have watched each and every one of the 21 preceding movies starting from over a decade ago, it is quite unnecessary. I'll just sum everything up with three little words: down memory lane."

Bringing together a story from 22 movies into one ever-moving, character-driven, hilarous, dark, and absolutely epic and exhilarating joyride is an achievement to behold. I want to express my gratitude to everyone who has worked with the MCU franchise, for giving us this monumental piece of entertainment history!This movie should earn its share of Oscars. At least the Best picture, best directing, actors and supporting actors (both male and female), writing, editing and cgi. And if there ever was a special category for reinventing the whole cinematic concept from a single movie to what a beast MCU is, then Kevin Feige should definiget that.Three hours of pure movie magic, and when it was over, I wondered how quickly it went. I loved how the trailer's didn't spoil anything, so the story was always fresh with funny, sad, epic and surprising moments. Focusing first on the surviving characters' loss, grief and relationship building and gradually upping up the action to the apocalyptic finale worked really well.I have been reading Marvel comics since 1980's and could have never imagined how awesome movies could be done in 30 years. The legacy of Stan Lee lies in capable hands, and he would have been pleased to see yet this one.Some highlights from acting perspective: Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth and RDJ - they absolutely nail everything every time they are on screen. If Hugh Jackman is Wolverine, these guys are Captain America, Thor and Iron Man! Awesome acting, in joy and sorrow, not just fighting over a CGI background. Special mention to Mark Ruffalo who seemed to have fun with his character all the time. And of course everyone else did their job with what screen time they ever got, whether it was a cgi character or not.There were so many meme-worthy funny/epic moments that I'm waiting for those to flood the internet, and that's always a good sign in a movie! But maybe Thor gets the most praise, both in acting and writing-wise. Looking so much towards Thor 4 if that ever happens. Another comedic highlights went, not surprisingly to Paul Rudd as Ant-Man and Bradley Cooper as "The Rabbit", but almost every character had their funny moments too, even Captain himself.The battles, especially the clash with three Avengers and Thanos towards the end were really well choreographed, as always in Russo movies. And oh boy does Captain America serve some mighty surprises with the equipment available! That alongside some really epic one-liner(s) make Cap stand out even in the end.Of course there are some glorious plotholes in the whole time travel/quantic realm thing, glowing like a Sorcerer Supremes' rings of teleportation, and one could eventually argue that a mere rat in a garage was the real hero here. But when you laugh, cry, wonder in awe and forget time and place and all your eartly sorrows for three magnificent hours, who the hell cares!And the end... it does come eventually, in its bittersweet form. See it yourself. No, experience it.Excelsior."

I was not planning on making a review, but this site DESPERATELY needs a proper one.Avengers Endgame is one of the best movies in the history of film. The acting is phenomenal, and most of the characters really capture the grief of losing their friends and/or family along with half of the universe to Thanos. And I also would like to add the fact that they made Thor a fat drunk, given that it is a realistic depiction of what would happen to Thor since he lost his father, mother, brother, relationship with his girlfriend, half his people, his homeland, and failing to save half of the universe. Everyone's stories tie in to the events of Endgame and in such impactful ways. This movie really knew how to just rip at your heartstrings.The plot and writing are solid, given that the events in the previous movies of the franchise tie in to this one. None of what happens during the movie is predictable, whether it be Thor chopping off Thanos' head at the beginning to exactly how the remaining Avengers gather the Infinity Stones.And from beginning to end of the final battle is enough to delight anyone, especially for anyone who watched the Marvel movies. I still remember seeing this movie in the theater, and everyone sitting in the chairs ERUPTED after Captain America said "Avengers, ASSEMBLE". It was the most epic climax I have ever seen in a movie.Overall, near perfect story, acting, fight scenes, themes, emotional setting, writing, and much more. I do not understand one reason why people would hate this movie and think it could have done any better. What a phenomenal way to end the Avengers movies."

Emotion Was 3000.","Avengers: Endgame suffers from too many plot holes, each with their own level of vastness. The story is confusing to a point where it almost doesn't make sense if you're willing to go through all its inconsistent elements.For one, Captain America going back in time with the Infinity Stones carries with it so many issues, that can be explained "six" different ways. The Gamora vs Black Widow conundrum is another that cannot be overlooked.Also, Hulk being able to handle the snap feels a bit too convenient, and honestly detracted from the magnificence of Thanos being the one able to conduct such power, and live to tell the tale.While we're at it, the past Thor never got Mjolnir back, and what happened with 2012's The Avengers ending, with Thor and Loki travelling to Asgard with the Tesseract, now that Loki disappeared, we know not where, with it?These are just some of the many problems Endgame is faced with, however, the fan service in this film was tremendous, and it's enjoyability is off the charts.The finale battle was stunning, and there were moments in Endgame that were explosive and triumphant. Thanos was amazing, and his death, a close second to Tony's, while Captain America also delivered impactful lines, that were worthy of well, you know. 6.5/10."

I thought the first 30 mins were great and really thought I was in for a treat of a film but then it sort of plateaued out for a couple hours. I think the time traveling idea was a good one and probably the only option they had for that story line in restoring the worlds population but I think it could have been done a little different perhaps with a little more action. The last 30 mins was a great battle and fairly similar to infinity war and I think it was right to kill off iron man and pretty much kill off captain America (although captain America going back to put the stones back has me questioning more of the time jump)The areas of the film that I really didn't enjoy were the treatment of 2 characters, thor.....fat and a slob!? I understand he felt responsible but his character was turned into a bit of a joke which was awful. Likewise the hulk, not really a man and not really the hulk but somewhere in between.....again I understand he found peace to live with the hulk but it was not done very well in my opinion.Going back to thor he was very close to defeating thanos in infinity war when thanos had stones, yet in end game thanos had no stones and Thor couldn't get close to him!Maybe I need to watch it a second time and like I said it was just a good film with a lot of holes and I couldn't help feel disappointed after the hype and build up."

The emotions are injected just right and even though the final moment of triumph was to be expected they added enough plot twists and suspense to make an ultimate defeat at least plausible.Why then don't I think that this isn't the best work in the MCU? Well, one reason might be that they walk back the character development of the main villain Thanos. In Infinity War he was presented as a villain who at least had a clear and somewhat logical motivation for his actions and he had to sacrifice to attain his ultimate goal. The Thanos we see defeated at the hands of the Avengers is one-dimensional and megalomaniacal like a cookie cutter comic book villain and his defeat hinges on several "changes of heart" by key characters which seem implausible considering their stage of development in the "time line".All that being said, this movie leaves the MCU in an interesting state to go forward. I just fear that the movie will not stand the test of time very well."

End Game is packed with emotion, thrills and a number great action scenes. There's some interesting ideas - a washed up Thor, a vengeful Hawkeye, Gamora's 'return', Hulk's Bannerisms, fighting duplicates, revisiting past films, forgotten characters and much more.Russo's instalment is no doubt entertaining but after the credits roll and tears are shed for two of your favourite characters (many more, if you like root for the bad guys) 'fridge logic' creeps in.Christopher Markus, Stephen McFeely and other writers grapple with time travel concept and shrug it off, wiping their hands of their responsibilities seemingly walking away by throwing in some one-liners and diagrams. Maybe they threw the time kitchen sink in by design so that fans will debate for many years. And that's the major issue with End Game, it doesn't work within its own logic with the writers moving their own goal posts. Sadly, even Doctors Strange's 1 in 14 million outcome is flawed. It's difficult enough to do films based solely on time travel, like Back to the Future, Timecrimes, Predestination to name a few and End Game just doesn't wrap it up neatly. You really do have to leave you brain at the door to buy into it.Overall, a great film, with hard hitting emotional closure moments but unfortunately they've left it to 14 million fan theories to tie up the lose ends and as just you make sense of it - annoyingly it throws up another paradox issue or question."

In both IW and EG, why he couldn't come out and is now in Hulk form but actually Banner wasn't explained well. Anyway, it seems it worked for the character even though Hulk/Banner always worked nicely.Iron Man and Captain America were done greatly. I expected a reversal of roles though. Cap sacrificing himself and Tony settling down with Pepper. Well, it still works if you ask me.Thanos on the other hand, w/o the IG is ten times stronger than with it apparently, fending of Thor and Tony and Cap vs just Thor.Black Widow's sacrifice was done well.Sam taking the shield is great.The best moment by far is when Cap starts swinging Mjollnir.I didn't get emotional, not the greatest movie by a longshot. Barely makes it and we'll see if it stays there when I re-watch it.Fingers crossed Cpt. Marvel gets recast by someone who can show emotions and isn't a cultural marxist and gets a substantial nerf. Then we can hope for the MCU."

Sign in to vote.,"Avengers Endgame (2019) 7.8","Avengers Endgame (2019) 7.8Act 1 - 7.3Act 2 - 7.4Act 3 - 8.6Tony's story arc was completed and worked very well. He finally settled down and got the family he always wanted. But inevitably sacrificed himself again but this time he didn't make it. Nice to see Tony interact with his father and have a final goodbye. Nice reunion between Peter and Tony. I liked the dynamic with Doctor Strange and Tony. Strange knew the only outcome in which they won was that Tony needed to sacrifice himself. So in the end Strange did choose the time stone over Tony.Cap traveling back in time to have that dance and kiss with Peggy was an almost perfect ending. They needed to meet at the bar they were going to meet at when Cap was going into the ice to have the most emotion impact. But still very good. Caps story is complete and has come full circle. Cap hands over the shield to Sam which I think was a nice touch. Old Cap was a great scene. Awesome when Cap using Thor's hammer.Didn't feel the emotions I should have when Nat sacrifices herself to get the soul stone. Nat would do anything to help her friends and that's what she did.I didn't like the Hulk Bruce mix that was going on. I'm not sure where his character will go from her, especially after losing Nat.Thor was enjoyable and funny but I did not like what they did to his character in this. At end of movie when he is fighting Thanos he has storm breaker which was stronger than the infinity gauntlet in the last film but he's getting his ass kicked when Thanos has no stones. That didn't make any sense. Looks like Thor is teaming up with the Guardians.Hawkeye turns into Ronin and I enjoyed him in this film and he gets a satisfying conclusion to his story.Ant man was enjoyable and constantly funny. Good to see other side characters.Captain Marvel was unnecessary in this film. When she teamed up with the social justice warriors it was the most forced and worst part of the film.Guardians of the Galaxy are all together again except for Gamora. It does look like Quill was looking for the time travel Gamora at the end of the film.Cool how they used time travel to revisit important parts of the Avengers lore. Looks like Loki could be alive now that he escaped at the end of the Avengers scene with the tesseract.Characters were strongly developed at this point so it is easy to invest in them. Movie was overall enjoyable and payed off the previous 21 films. Excited to see where they take the MCU from here. Movie had stakes and emotional weight, just not enough. I like how they used Thanos in the film combined with Nebula.I enjoyed the pairing they had in the film but wish we could have had the original core avengers all together a little more throughout the film.Effects were great. Makeup was very good. Cinematography was also very good. Dialogue was consistent for the characters throughout the film. Wish they had a little less humor to greater the emotional stakes.Movie did feel dull at points and did t carry the emotional impact it needed to take a scene over the top. Runtime at 3 hours didn't feel too long. Just wish they capitalized on some more moments to make them more emotional. Time travel being introduced to the MCU takes away all of the stakes in every future film. They can now undo anything that goes wrong.Overall a satisfying conclusion to a now 22 film story arc. Got time with every character and I logical conclusion to every character for that film. I would change a few things here in their to better suit my liking but the film did have weight to it and payed off in the end."

Thor was mostly a mess, Falcon is ridiculous as the new Captain America, and Scarlet Witch wasn't used nearly enough.

Sign in to vote.,"Maybe the saga should have stopped with IW and then rebooted....","I'm all about suspension of disbelief, especially when I'm watching a superhero movie. BUTA rat sets the whole movie plot in motion (so, Dr. Strange saw 14,000,605 timelines x 5 years each).Aparrently, Thanos wiped all the waste collectors, or half the earth's population was so sad, they stopped bothering with trash.An entire spaceship travels in time through a portal where people need a special suit and pym particles to do that.One of the avengers could have gone back to find dr Pym and have him make more particles (or steal some) before the mission. Stress-free quantum time hops for everybody!One of them could have just gone back to Thor and tell him to go for the head. But that would create a paradox and that is a no no. OR IS IT? Captain America travels back in time and lives the life he missed, waits for Peggy to die in a world without Captain America (but with one extra, deep frozen, Steve Rogers), and then returns to the original timeline, but before anyone has ever setup equipment for quantum time travel (or getting back from it). Basically he returns the stones so that no paradox is created, and then creates a paradox/new timeline to live in. Okay that makes sense.Those that moved on with their lives are going to have to do so much explaining to their previously loved ones. Oh, and Spiderman Far From Home had better take place in 2023 because they already messed up with that timeline.The movie overall is so fascinating that these, and other minor plot incoscistencies didn't bother me at all, the payoff in the assembling scene was SO worth it. The effects are incredible (apart from the Michael Douglas de-aging, that was a bit cringey). The feels when the original avengers close their character arcs are overwhelming.Fat drunk Thor is welcome as a comic relief for 2-3 minutes, then it's just unbearable. Hulk Dab and Fortnite felt like 50 year olds wrote the script. The "female avengers" gathering at the same place same time in such an enormous battle could only happen in one out of 14,000,605 realities, one where Marvel is trying to force feed us feminism or akwardly trying to please women who were dragged by their boyfriends in the theatre.Unlike IW, I won't be seeing this a second time in the theatre. You can show IW to someone who's only seen 2 or 3 Marvel movies after giving him some quick tips, and he'll be excited af by the time it's over. Show him EG which has half the characters and he'll probably be confused.After the hype dies down, and a million Thor memes pop up on the nets, people will realise this is far from perfect, but it couldn't have been better because it had to close so many arcs and it had to contain time travel. And time travel is the price we pay for the masterpiece that was the IW ending."

I have nothing against long movies, but I feel like there were parts of the movie that could've been trimmed out. The movie was a bit too jokey and lighthearted at times for me to enjoy. I feel like with as high as the stakes were in this movie, the comedy elements should've been toned down. I did not feel like having Captain America stay in the past and grow old was a good way to end his arc. I also did not think that having Iron Man die in this movie was a good way to end his arc either. I did like how Thor joined the Guardians of the Galaxy, and I have no problems with how strong Captain Marvel is."

Sign in to vote.,"Infinity War was too good for a sequel","Serious spoilers ahead - I'll try to limit them but only read this if you've already seen the film.Overall, I enjoyed Endgame, but I was left disappointed with a few things...For me, Infinity War is one of the best superhero movies ever made. Possibly only second place to the The Dark Knight. I can watch it over and over again and love everything about it - the storyline, the humour, the music, the quality of the special effects, the commitment of the acting and the superb allocation of screen time to each character as and when they deserve it (no more, no less) plus what is at stake is clear. The action is brilliant and the climax is stunning.Infinity War is a hard act to follow and so, whilst looking forward to Endgame, I was also nervous, particularly with the introduction of Captain Marvel into the MCU who appeared to be more invincible than Superman on an all-spinach diet. It seemed as though she could sort things out all on her own. Thankfully, the first act of Endgame addressed and allayed all of those fears. The obvious solution was enacted and Thanos proved himself to be the deserved victor.Cut to five years later and everyone is dealing with the repercussions of Thanos's genocide.I was happy to see that Ant-Man had an central purpose for being part of the story, otherwise there's a danger of his presence being for decoration only. That said, I'm always very nervous when time-travel is part of any storyline. There are few films outside of the original Back To The Future that are able to pull it off flawlessly. Dialogue gets wordy as characters have to explain the rules and, whilst you're following a "new" storyline, you're revisiting old ground and waiting the real story to get under way. Once again, the story only really gets some momentum when Thanos and co. are introduced into the mix. Unfortunately, this time round, there wasn't enough of them.One thing I love about the MCU is that they push things further each time and generally don't repeat themselves. Every time you see Thor or Iron Man, for example, there is something new about them. Endgame uses a lot of humour as part of this, however, humour as a disguise for lack of story progression can only go so far and, whilst Ragnarok did it very well, Endgame started to push its luck.It is a very long film and doesn't need to be so. It felt as though it was a studio requirement to get as many of the actors from all the other films into Endgame and then put them on screen for a long enough time to warrant their fee. The Michael Douglas scene was fine, but scenes with Thor's mum and Tony's dad felt dragged out.There are some tearjerker moments in this film that are dealt with very well in the moment - you realise that you'll never see some of these characters again. However, when you overplay that with talking scenes, things drift into sentimentality that just add needless minutes, in particular the scenes with Happy and the kid, Barton and Wanda and the final scene between Captain America and Falcon, which brought back memories of the final scene from The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.Thanos is one of the greatest villains in film history. Josh Brolin's performance and the flawless work of the CGI department are second-to-none and Thanos's original mission-a 50% thinning of the herd-is not wholly without its logic (neither film, by the way, addresses an alternative solution to the problem of overpopulation. The most you get from the side of the Avengers is Gamora shouting, "You don't know that!" at Thanos. But how *will* The Avengers solve the issue when the time comes and there's not enough food or territory left?).As a side-note, one thing about the entire MCU saga that should be address but almost has to be overlooked is the inconsistencies of strength and power. For example, the six infinity stones can turn Drax into dismantled building blocks and kill trillions of people, but can't stop a magic axe. In the next film, the axe can be stopped by Thanos's metal sword. Really?The final big fight was ludicrously glorious in scale. The return of several characters was truly joyous.However, my main disappointment with Endgame comes down to one thing: not enough Hulk. The introduction of The Professor was a nice progression of the character as well as being an amusing choice but beyond that, we hardly saw anything that warranted him being in the film. Speaking as a Hulk fan, I want to see Hulk being Hulk - effective whilst smashing things with rage. As there was almost nothing of him in Infinity War, I was hoping that was because the filmmakers were holding back in order for us to see him really kick off as Red Hulk in Endgame, but we saw more of Ant Man in the final fight than we saw of Hulk. A real missed opportunity there.Ultimately, I found it an enjoyable film with lots of unnecessary fat to trim. The time travel plot worked to an extent and the universe was brought back into balance neatly whilst staying true to the rules it laid in place and wiping the slate for a new Avengers team.My criticisms stand alongside an understanding of how challenging it must be to put together a film on this scale, with this number of characters, to please such a passionate audience, and after one of the most impressive superhero films ever made. But my disappointment comes from the fact that these things *could* have been addressed."

This movie exists to now give us some happiness and see these characters get the dub. But since we know they will win we have to have a interesting way as to HOW they win over Thanos. And instead of a deep and personal. Or at all creative way. They use convoluted time travel. I've seen ads with a better plot as now they have to have a throw away gag scene t verify why they don't kill Thanos as he is being born Terminator style. The problem with the film is is there wasn't enough time given for the writers to stretch the hands and give these characters time. Instead of a 5 year time jump. Also Blck Widow's death is hot trash for how long she's been in this Universe so. Stop"

As of now, I like the fact that Steve chooses tits and happiness over morality and honor. The ramifications of his choice are vast and whatever the case paints Steve in a bad light when you think about it. Yet, it calls back Frigga's talk with Thor. Even heroes fail and make bad choices.Thor and his flaws/journey. Love that Thor becomes comfortable with who he is at the end of his journey. That scene with Frigga was powerful. Thor is NO Odin and doesn't want to be.Tony's sacrifice and his final taped goodbye. Part of the journey is the end and what a way to go out. Frankly, it makes no sense why Dr. Strange couldn't have used the Time Stone to reverse the damage to just Tony's body. Putting that aside, it really was an emotional and powerful end to the MCU as we know it. Given the downward direction of the future of the MCU, it may grow even more fitting that there is now a clear classification and border. Everything pre- RDJ Tony Stark and everything after RDJ Tony Stark. "I AM IRON MAN" indeed.Fanboy Fangasmic Action: Cap calling and using Mjolnir!!! Wanda's take out of Thanos! Giant-Man's left cross KO's one of those flying Leviathans from the first Avengers film.ConsThe use of "Hippie Hulk" and his baffling lack of action and inclusion by the Russo's. Professor Hulk is a great concept but used mostly for comedic purposes sits wrong with most fans of the character. It's clear the Russo's didn't know what to do with the Hulk.Asinine social justice seeds were so unnecessary and moved beyond annoying. Small scenes yet they were awkward and signal exactly why the future of the MCU seems to be headed in the wrong direction.One that note, Captain Marvel being shoe-horned in to the movie was completely awful. Thank God her character was given little to do and didn't ruin the overall quality of the story. Yet, she remains a HUGE negative to anything in the MCU.Lack of notable action until the final act and even then everything descending in to chaos and wild CGI madness. They spent far too long on the CGI massive battle and not enough time on the Thor/Iron Man/Cap VS Thanos showdown."

Marvel Cinematic Universe with Avengers: Endgame - the end of an era - made the best look bad. It is one of the most satisfying movies ever.Captain America turns out to be worthy for Thor's Mjolnir and saves him mid-fight. This was important for Cap's character as he is the righteous person, but Thor's fans will feel bad at this.Endgame has been the best in every aspect but the time-travel related complexities. Marvel actually killed it by introducing a new time-travel timeline type, given that every other movie uses one of the conventional types. But they just skipped over some important details. We've seen dozens of minutes of screen-time spent on the birth of Vision and the Iron suit and the mini-arc reactor in the previous MCU movies, why not the time machine? This oversight in explaining the time travel bothers me. The whole infinity 'war' is 5 hrs long. This is a small setback, they should've gotten deeper into the time machine stuff.That 4-second Peggy Carter and Steve Rogers scene was one of the most pleasing things. I would LOVE to see more of Nat. But she's getting a film all about herself, and that settles things. Loki didn't return but we have already mourned for him."

The sad moments were sad, and the fun moments were fun, they did their job.The plot was very interesting in the fa t that we, as the ultra fans, were brought back in time on a nostalgic journey though our past memories of this amazing franchise. But sometimes the time travel aspect of it went a bit on, and kept on going when i thought we saw enough of it.Then the final hour of the film comes in, and it was EPIC. Once again Cap was unbelievable, best part of the film by a mile, Tony was the same old Tony that we know and Love, and he was rightfully the one to end it all. However I didn't feel as saddend as I thought I would be about Tony at the end, I just felt glad that he was the one to end it, and the funeral at the end was not as AMAZING as I expected, as this was the most relevant character in the most relevant franchise of all time, and passed away. Having watch both seasons of Agent Carter I found Caps ending severely heartwarming.Overall, this film stayed off slow and average but eventually it was abosolutly stunning, but a few slightly disappointing little things near the end that don't really bother me.I would say that Infinity War was better, as there was ZERO cons for me, and this has quite a few and Infinity War left me with no regrets in terms of directors' decisions.2nd best MCU film imo, ABSOLUTELY STUNNING FILMAlso, when Doctor Strange released all the superhero's to fight, I was really hoping the guys from the tv-shows would be there amongst them all, that would be perfect."

It has a lot of pacing issues its just drawn out and boring in a lot of parts.Infinty war is almost as long and yet its much better paced and more fun.The fact that only one superhero died in the last fight is ridicilous,honestly the movie should have ended with them killing thanos and realising they cant bring anyone back.There are things i like tho cap was handled yust how i hoped,black widow and hawkeye were never that interesting before this movie and they finally have a personality i love what they did with nebula this movie really humanised her.Cap vs thanos is one of the best fight scenes ever so there is that the movie is OK"

Sign in to vote.,"Sigh, it was everything that was expected (Spoilers)","TL;DR: A lot of rambling from me, wished for more epic ending.What an utter and complete disappointment. Gonna list some things I didn't like first.I went to this movie with expectations that Tony is the one to die from the Big 3. Reasoning being that in my opinion ( Since seeing ending of BP) Marvel is obviously setting MJ (Spider-Man) to be a Power Duo with Shuri ( Black Panther's Sister) now that she is head of the Wakanda's NY Embassy. and hey someone needs to fix Spider-Man's new nanosuit right? Iron Woman inc? MJ can take Pepper's suit, and someone can post on Reddit how Chekov's Gun her reading a Recycling book was.Really disappointed for that tony death, even more disappointed how they handled it.Time travel also happens, that was lame AF. I hoped writers would have actually surprised us, feels like shitty writing.Complete victory. Traded Black Widow and Stark for victory? Talk about a cheap win.There was no point in the movie were it felt like the stakes were high and Avengers were actually losing something. From start to finish its just a victory parade IMO.Serious lack of dialogue! I really wanted more 1 on 1 discussions between the characters I.E Bucky and Captain talking before he time jumps at the end, Nebula commenting on why she shot herself, Myabe Thanos commenting that maybe he lacked experience that 9 year older Thanos had, Captain Marvel speaking whole sentence, or just something!Most discussions between characters were just humor stuff , nothing meaningful or long. Dialogue really feels soulless to me, factory mill quality.MY PERSONAL FAVORITE, so ruined RUINED I SAY, if u remember at the end of Infinity War, We see Thanos' Hut, well when I saw it first time, I thought it was Hawkeye's Hut. I was expecting to see Hawkeye happy and smiling eating with his family when the SNAP happens, and he has to watch everyone dust while passing the salad. God damn the Endgame scene of dusting his family lacks any emotional impact. and the Hawkeye's actor could have carried that scene 100%! His face on Endgame trailer, really says how ashamed he is what he has become, how he is angry at himself and the shame he feels because Nat saw him like that. This was the thing I was most hyped about!!! and talking about lack of dialogue man Hawkeye - Captain America interaction would have been nice.I wish they had spent more effort on the #Metoo scene. I hate to call it that. but that is what it felt like. It should have been longer. No actress got to really do anything on that, and I still didn't get my fill of Pepper Potts being a badass warrior, just like with Iron Man 3. Also pissed that Maria Hill wasn't included (not even in the movie god damn). Maybe Marvel hates Canada (hi mum!). Worst thing about it was how Valkyrie's Pegasus was completely fine after taking a shot from the Mothership cannon, even all pure white still lol.Falcon becoming Captain America and Valkyrie becoming a Queen , both come out of left field for me. When did Valkyrie show any leadership qualities? Bizarre.And on Falcon's case it doesn't feel like he has earned it. at least not yet. Guess I am excited for Falcon solo movie now and reserve judgement until then on that call.Oh yeah, Loki's death received no mention in whole movie huh. also shame no Hela. Would have loved to see Thor ask about her from the Mother.Black Order was a joke, again, just like in IW, although way bigger joke this time around. Shame.Soulstone Gang each getting a action scene looked hilarious stupid to me. Okey 1st Spider-Man show you are here, now Panther, Strange get the ocean and so on.This is the Final Movie, how the hell do u not top all the other Avenger group battle scenes by miles?? Lack of effort is insane IMO. Yes I like Portals but am not giving a free pass because of them god damnit.Marvel failed to stop the Captain marvel Deus Ex Machina.I would have appreciated a better,longer fight scene with Danvers and Thanos. That Scene really felt like a writer was jerking off " Look u baby audience am empowering a woman and giving Stark idea what to do, I AM A GENIUS" . Sorry, it just looked so cliche and stupid easy. Would probably have been fine without the Strange-Stark eye-to-eye stuff. Cinematography left a lot to be desired on all that.Would have liked to see bigger movement to try to move on after the snap than just an AA meeting.Wanted more Nebula-Stark scenes.Then NEUTRAL STUFF, all this stuff felt like "duh obviously, its not like anything eelse even could happen, but it was still good"Hulk FusionHawkeye-Black Widow exchangeCaptain America staying backThe GOOD STUFFThor's depression. I don't have the writing skills to praise enough Hemsworth's performance or writing on that. He was definitely my favorite part of this movie. Just a shame that him being little chubby didn't show in the fight scenes or impact his fighting ability.Captain getting the Scepter with "Hail Hydra" . also love that they teased a elevator fight. Will probably watch Winter Soldier tomorrow!Captain America and the Hammer, expected , but damn I love how he fights with the hammer.Rating:I am giving this movie the lowest marvel movie rating I have ever given. It is not the worst Marvel movie for me, that Honor belongs to Dr. Strange (its so damn boring and slow paced and I even love all the actors in it), BUT this is supposed to be the epic finale for the 1st arch of MCU, and in that it utterly fails. and the score reflects that failure.It also suffers from Infinity War (My favorite MCU Movie) being so damn good, and pales in comparison sadly.This really reminds me of how my favorite Game of Thrones episodes are mostly 2nd last episodes and how I haven't liked almost any of the season endings.If I would have to guess, its because when you are good at writing, there is one logical outcome that fits the story you have been building and people that have seen a lot of movies, can figure it out. And I hate having figured out the story, I always want to be surprised when watching a movie! For it to go far and beyond my expectations. Didn't happen this time.Thanks for bothering to read this if you did!"

I was waay hyped after Infinity War(2018) and was wondering what will happen but time travel, c'mon! This is a historal movie most of the people will watch it but this laziness? I am just sad. With adding time travel to universe there will be no excitement anymore, every villian will be able to be defeated using that. And why bother having another Thanos? He is not the Thanos we know, they just threw the character development away. Other than time travel it was GREAT. The final fight was all I asked for, well other than fat thor and Hulk being missing. I mean why didnt Hulk get his rematch with thanos? And the A-Force thing when all the women got together, I wanted to puke. There is a lot of things I hate about this movie and millions of ways that it could be better, but I can't give it a love rating. I guess you can't be a Marvel fan without hatlng Marvel."

1,23-Apr-22,masihh-37679,0,0,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"This film was both good and bad in theory","I neither admire nor blame this film. The film had several problems. One of them is that if someone takes the hammer, he will have the power of Thor, but when Captain America took the hammer, he did not gain the power of Thor and could only use the power of the hammer and the hammer. Not the power of Thor .Because when it came time to fight Tanus, he had no more arm strength.Because in one of the parts of Thor, his father Odin ordered the hammer to be taken by anyone who deserves the power of Thor, but in this part, Captain America received only the power of the hammer and electricity. The second problem with this movie was the death of Iron Man because he was the beating heart of the band and in fact everyone thinks he is the beating heart of Captain America but he was actually Iron Man. I know that with the death of Tony Stark, the film became more interesting, ending the tedious process that other films had, but in fact, Tony Stark was a very attractive and shrewd character who was able to play the best role in this film.but the third problem with the film was that Thor was weak. We know that Thor was frustrated and weak because he had lost the previous war and did not have the former power, but in reality he is a god and should have more power than other creatures.But in many other films and this film showed the power of Thor weak, for example in the part of Thor Reknorak. In my opinion, the infinity war was more beautiful."

It's riddled with far too many plot holes, cringy humor and weird character choices for me to give it anything over a 5. Hulk and Thor are completely butchered here as characters imo. The 2nd act is boring and does every time travel cliché you could think of, third act however, although blatant fan service is fun and exciting to watch. 3rd act basically saves the movie. The main reason I saw this was to see how Captain America's arc ends since he is one of the few characters I care about in the mcu. Unfortunately Iron Man's arc is done way better here compared to Cap's. No spoilers but Captain America's ending is shoehorned in at the last second and makes no sense. It felt completely unnatural . Oh yeah and hulk dabs, in the year 2023."

I am not going to spoil it, but watching a million CGI characters appear on both sides was like letting all the air out of the tires. All the dramatic build-up was lost when it became a billions against billions battle.Which brings up the fact that at least 90 minutes of this movie is spent on boring scenes of various Avengers feeling depressed about the death of the heroes, and going to support group meetings. We get it. The Avengers are depressed. This could have been covered in fifteen minutes or less in a group meeting. We did not need to follow each Avenger through their depressing trip down memory lane. Thank God Ant Man came back from the quantum universe and got the ball rolling!!Unfortunately, Thor becomes the punchline for jokes throughout the movie. Since Captain Marvel is the new #1 hero, they had to power down Thor by turning him into a drunken hobo. The Incredible Hulk has spent the past three movies (Thor Ragnarok, Infinity War, & this one) in permanent erectile dysfunction, and he continues to be a zero in this movie. Thor and the Hulk are just here to be the focus of comedy as has-beens. Even Bruce Banner as a scientist gets slapped down. Michael Douglas and the Pym Particles have to fix what Bruce Banner fails to do. It is a very sad way for two of Marvel's earliest and most powerful heroes to end their game.There are a lot of good moments in Endgame. Most of them happen when the small crew of Avengers is trying to find the original gems. Then the battle when it is just the small group against Thanos is excellent. It was building up to a great ending, Captain America & Iron Man defeating Thanos, against all odds. Even Thor was redeeming himself in the battle! That is how this Marvel Comics masterpiece could have ended. But they had to throw in the billions of CGI characters and turn it into a big circus act... Too bad. Less was more."

Unsurprisingly perhaps, I found that it was very much the overall picture I found with Infinity War, which is that it is far from perfect, a blockbuster pure and simple, but that it is quite a piece of work in terms of how well put together it all is.In terms of that structure, at time of writing this there are quite a few comments comparing it to the final season of Game of Thrones (which right now just has 2 episodes left) in the way that it has to bring everything together. The comparison is unfavorable, partly because GoT continues it very rushed approach to writing, but mainly because Endgame does it very well. The detail of the plotting is of course filled with holes that are best just to ignore, but the structure allows for a very nice conclusion as we retouch on moments from within the existing films, allowing nostalgia, references, and a sense of winding it up (although of course it will continue as long as the films make money). As with Infinity War, the writing somehow gives characters enough time despite there being so many of them; it hits several tones but none undercuts or takes away from another; and it mixes humor and action into a plot that takes itself seriously enough so it feels like it has weight.Of course it is still a blockbuster film, and far from perfect, but it is impressively done and very easy to enjoy if you go with what it is doing."

This film is sure to satisfy those who have been impressed with the last couple of phases of Marvel films, I personally gravitate towards the Phase One films. This direct sequel to last years Infinity War starts off quite slow for the first hour or so and I think this will be the main complaint by most people but I did not mind the low key hangs with these surviving characters. The film does pick up though and has a few laughs along the way, some above average action, fun hijinx but the whole time I am thinking this story is wasted on these terrible visual directors. Marvel films are all pretty bland but the Russos make spectacle so damn ugly. That said most of the conclusions are satisfying from a story point of view bar some small missteps here and there."

Sign in to vote.,"The best comic book movie of all time and the best movie ever.","After Infinity War there was one thought floating around my mind... how in the hell can they ever hope to top that? The answer? Avengers Endgame. For the bulk of the first act there's a sense of doom and dread, and there's a difficult balance the filmmakers the Russos and writers Stephen Mcfeely and Christopher Markus had to maintain: The balance between drama and appropriate doses of humor.Not every superhero movie can accomplish that, but it seems like this being the fourth collaboration between the Russos and Mcfeely and Markus, they know the Avengers just as well as us, the audience do. There's several things that make this movie work so beautifully, first and foremost the writing. The Avengers interact better than ever, going from a team to sounding like best friends. They are united by their bond, by their loss and they all feel a moral and ethical duty to do everything and anything in their power to fix what Thanos did, last seen in Infinity War.The other thing that makes this movie work so great is that there's a point to which the Avengers are at their lowest point... like they look like they are on the verge of absolute defeat... then suddenly... SUDDENLY... something happens and when it does it's the most amazing feeling in the world for us, the audience.Markus/Mcfeely and the Russos know how to create great tension, which keeps you on the end of your seat and wondering... what's going to happen next?! You might think you know what's going to happen next, but the tension in this film is so great you find yourself wondering because how... how could the Avengers possibly win this time?! I've watched this movie at least 30 times now, and I think I can safely say this movie will never get old for me.In the end, there's a lot of tears, a lot of smiles, and all around great feelings because after so many decades of being a DC fanboy, the Marvel Cinematic universe has now and forever surpassed DC as the king of Comic book films. Avengers Endgame is an outstanding event film, one that will not be topped for a long time."

We're the Avengers. We gotta finish this." Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.)Don't believe for a minute that Marvel's Comic Universe is finished after Avengers: Endgame. It may be curtains for archenemy Thanos (Josh Brolin), but a multibillion-dollar MCU franchise has much yet to accomplish. In Endgame, playing with time like a time machine allows the heroes a chance to reverse the "inevitable" work of their nemesis to save the world.The more important time motif here is the three hours of viewing, from which no time machine can spare us. Yet, the genius of the directors Russo and their writers is to make the time go in warp speed, filling the screen with engaging characters and their actors, witty lines not forcing sarcasm but dishing soft irony. The visuals are equally almost underplayed so that it's an organic whole with no element, even music, dominating.What does dominate is the abiding humanity where love and hate, empire and home, and collaboration not individualism are evidenced in fleshed-out characters and universal themes carefully but never overpoweringly used. The motif of people working as a team for the communal good underlies heroic actions while searching for home and family is the motivating sympathy binding almost all the major characters.The honor roll includes Black Widow (Scarlett Johannson), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Iron Man (Downey Jr.), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), War Machine (Don Cheadle), Okoye (Danai Gurira), Rocket (Bradley Cooper), Captain Marvel (Brie Larson), and Captain America (Chris Evans). And too many more to list, the point being these actors have become the heroes; kudos to successful casting directors.Although I must allow the usual tropes to bind us in sci-fi sympathy, I will always complain that the final act has too many explosions and fist fights (really, with the super tech available to these star travelers, why must the ultimate decider be old-fashioned brute force?). Despite that complaint, I find the movie thrillingly entertaining, a great example for the uninitiated into the genre. I must say there are fewer explosions in the first two acts than usual. Hooray.For those of us who have seen much sci-fi, Avengers: Endgame has just about all the best qualities we have seen and loved. The humanism dominates:"Even if there's a small chance that we can undo this, I mean, we owe it to everyone who is not in this room, to try." Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson)"

With their remaining allies, and a few new ones as well, they devise an elaborate, last-ditch scheme vowing to do whatever it takes to restore the world as they once knew it. Well-crafted, often intensely emotional story is much different in style and in tone than its immediate predecessor, and though the pace lags at times when it gets caught up in the necessary plot jabber (which may raise more questions than answers) it unfolds in ways you wouldn't quite expect with slick, clever twists and in-jokes, wonderful lines, moments of true nostalgia and heroism that pay tribute to the many characters that dedicated followers have come to love over the years.

This film never stops and I even cared about and was into the action, which I rarely did before.I will rewatch this for sure, which I often don't want to do with most of Marvel, and absolutely don't know what to even say anymore. I love it, and as someone who likes superhero movies but often doesn't love them, that just blows me away.It is so well put together, and just wow.I mean wow.I mean I fell asleep while watching a bunch of these flicks, surely not with this one. Three hours. And they made it work. That's so insane."

This is "THE FIGHT OF OUR LIVES!"Of course, this was a film on my anticipation list. I didn't put it on the actual list because it was a given. I've been with this extensive universe for 10, going on 11, years. Going into the cinema, I was excited and worried, because I knew that this would be the end of an era and characters. Coming out I was exhausted in the best possible way. I, and the entire audience, were full of emotions both happy and sad. Now let's get into why.POSITIVES!After Infinity War, we were all coming back no matter what! The plot is obviously about reversing what had happened, but all of us are invested in this world, so obviously we were onboard with that. Without spoilers, the course the film takes is fantastic. Although it has a slow start, it was fantastic to slow down and deal with the impact of the Infinity War events and to see these incredible characters cope and to see how the actors performed. Everyone is great, as always. Robert Downey Jr. is fantastic. Audiences get to see an impeccable performance from the man that started it all and he is in good company. The core Avenger characters/actors are all great. Where Renner and the writers take Hawkeye is epic. Chris Evans is awesome as Cap and Johansson shines bigtime in the film. Although Josh Brolin's Thanos' appearance is limited, audiences have Infinity War to understand the character! Anthony and Joe Russo return with a punch. Taking risks in the story and action. AND THE ACTION! The final action sequence is easily my favourite action sequence among the MCU movies! The Russo Bros have an incredible ability, that they utilized in The Winter Soldier, where they showcase a character in a small role but make them large. This is what they used in Infinity War and Endgame and that made them perfect to helm to two-parter finale. The Russo Bros also had two shots that made me super emotional. The first is the final shot and it's a tear jerker from an emotional standpoint. And the other occurs as the film wraps up and it showcases how far the MCU has come. They also cameoed more of the Community cast which was hilarious! The entire film flows incredibly well and doesn't at all feel like a 3 Hour epic. This is a praise to the editors of the film, never once making the audience bored in the way they formed the narrative. The visual effects are stunning. In Infinity War I had a problem with the digital image mixed with the live action, but not here. Everything is seamless. From the digital characters to the action. It has got a lot of beautiful and familiar artwork and sets that all blend well together. The costumes are fantastic. Iron Man's and Cap's costumes were fantastic adaptations of the source material. But then again, there were other updated costumes and makeup that were welcomed upgrades. Alan Silvestri's score is used to perfection in the most epic moments! There is so much that I enjoyed and loved, but I love the fact that there are two things that occur in the third act that I have been awaiting for such a long time and the fact that they used both in the epic action sequence was the best thing to occur onscreen for such a long time!NEGATIVES!The problems I have with the film are minor and don't impact my opinion significantly. Most of these are to do with the writing. Like I said before, the film has a slow first act. Once we get past that the film picks up, but it's still there. Again, without spoiling the movie, the film deals with a certain plot device and being a huge fan of that certain device, after the movie finished, I started to deconstruct it and not a lot of it works. But that's nit-picking. The humour between characters works very well, but the humour for the audience not so much. The film takes itself seriously, and that is awesome! It's just that the humour and comedic elements are weak. Thor is awesome in the final act but before then he is used as comedic relief with how the character is displayed and portrayed, and it feels forced and unwarranted. It's unfortunate because Hemsworth was so hilarious in Thor: Ragnarok and those comedic elements flowed well into Infinity War, but not here. And lastly, this is an issue not to do with the movie but the audience. There is a lot of references and cameos to past MCU films, like a lot. And whilst this is fantastic and helps wrap up storylines and character arcs, there will be audience members that don't appreciate the references because they hadn't seen the MCU movies/franchises being referenced. Example; someone that watches The Avengers franchise but doesn't watch the Guardians of the Galaxy movies may not understand certain scenes. Not the Guardians in particular, just an example.CONCLUSION!So, Avengers: Endgame satisfies the biggest MCU fans and Marvel Comics fans with its interpretation of story and character. There are so many epic moments, along with the powerful and sad scenes that will cause a few tears due to a great script and fantastic acting. This isn't my absolute favourite MCU movie, but it's high on the list. It's the Endgame and the stories that the film wraps up are done in an appropriate and epic fashion."

There are constant attempts at humor that feel forced and unnatural (most of Rocket's dialogue feels that way). The whole movie felt like it was saying good-bye instead of building the story. The action scenes were pretty bad. Sure, lots of special effects and great CGI but again, there was nothing supporting any of that. It's the worst Avengers movie and while it might have generated some box office revenue, the story and dialogue are completely forgettable."

Sign in to vote.,"A continuation of "Infinity War", Thanos has to be dealt with and it takes all Avengers.","My wife and I watched this movie at home on DVD from our public library, about 11 months after we similarly watched "Infinity War" where Thanos wanted to destroy half the universe.In fact the very first scene of this one depicts people, parts of families, just disappearing. Thanos is so powerful, and possessing all the infinity stones, would take a giant coordinated effort by all the Avengers to figure out a way to defeat him. And only some kind of time travel to secure each infinity stone would enable them to accomplish what is needed.The movie is long, very long, at just over 3 hours with the credits. We just can't watch a 3-hour movie in one sitting after steak and wine so we watched it over two consecutive nights.It is a good movie, characterizations are very good, as is the inventiveness of the story line. The least interesting to me were the CGI-full epic, frantic battles. They just became audio and video "noise" to me. But the hand-to-hand fighting was much better, as were the actual interactions of various characters.I don't see a listing for the next Avengers movie so is this the last one?"

If they cut out all the filler, it would've only been 2 hours long, not 3. I also didn't like how the scriptwriters and filmmakers couldn't really work out if they wanted the movie to be serious, emotional and epic, or filled with a hundred funny but silly jokes to pad the run-time.Regardless, I still enjoyed it. The plot was good, the jokes were funny, the CGI was good, and the soundtrack was decent. It was definitely better than Captain Marvel."

One of the best MCU movies if not the best.Very good story with great atmosphere and tone, it's a bit less funny than Infinity War but had my laughs here and there. The movie also dragged on a bit too long but the pacing is tolerable for the most part. The directing and writing were also very good. The dynamics between the characters were great such as Hawkeye and Black Widow.

Yes, a fitting conclusion because it appears the MCU did die with Endgame. Everything from here on out looks to be woke cancer. Still, after the masterpiece of Infinity War, we all wanted better. Most characters were written out of character. What they did to Captain America and Hulk is criminal. The sad conclusion to Tony Stark's ark may be emotional but ultimately it was unnecessary. Add some cringe woke elements dribbling into this and it's clear why the movie wasn't as good as it should have been."

1,2-May-19,teleconman,1,4,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"Avengers: Endgame: Marvel's Best Yet","Avengers: Endgame is probably the most anticipated film of this year. Thank goodness it came early or else we would still be discussing fan theories like crazy. But to be truly honest I have never known a film to be this exciting. Of course, as you all may know, these characters became part of our lives and put their legacies in cinematic history as quite possibly the most successful franchise of them all. Endgame was the cherry on top of 21 films that all intertwined in some way. And boy was the payoff worth it. The film immediately gets you going into the lives of the remaining avengers post-Thanos' snap.( I assume you know that already and therefore know that that is a spoiler fo Infinty War). But it's after that that the ball gets going. There is really no dull moment in this film that had me wishing I had a remote in my hand to fast forward. That's a lot to say considering that the film is three hours. But you know what? It's worth every second. The film is packed with a lot of material that will get you wanting to talk about the movie days after you've seen it. I feel that this film will affect you in a lot of areas... so get excited. However as far as superhero movies go, I don't think it's the best one. I think that there are flaws that can't be ignored and too many questions surrounding the plot. But the film does make it up in other parts. I loved what I saw and it's definitely a film I would enjoy seeing again."

That is epic storytelling for sure. Congrats to the writers and Marvel for integrating all the assets in their universe so well.But was it well done? Generally, I'd say "yes". I think having so many characters involved watered down the movie's intensity and impact. But still, it's an amazing movie for the scope, scale and visuals that were achieved.If you get a chance to see it in 3D, do it. Some good effort was spent in making the 3D version extra spectacular and immersive. Either way, if you enjoy Marvel movies, this one's not to be missed."

This film deserves to be seen as it is; a beauty.Pros;RDJ, Jeremy Renner, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Chris Evans & surprisingly Karen Gillan are no short of fantastic. Each actor truly delves into their characters and give masterful performances. Gillan was a nice surprise in how much she did and changed from her previous films.The CGI was (I will say) near flawless. Nothing ever looked completely fake and most looked incredibly realistic.The actions was gorgeous. Seriously; if it were a fetish, you would enjoy yourself TOO much.It abides so Well to the continuity and is believable in its world. We see the events of Infinity War taking a toll on the world, we get rich callbacks to (Nearly) every single film!Whilst slightly tying to the previous point, the fan service is fabulous. Some fans will be in awe to see what happens.The cinematography is beautiful and lots of shots are stunning and would give Film Theory a run for its money (Not saying much but whatever).The emotion is gut-wrenching. If you have stuck with these movies; you WILL cry.The film focused on the characters that bettered the story. Some characters appeared briefly, but when so it worked!Cons;The humour whilst not undercutting any serious emotion is not as refined as the other movies. Still funny but not AS funny as (Example) Infinity War.Verdict;The mould is broken, the tables have turned. As a beautiful show of the MCU's patience & Storytelling, Avengers: Endgame exceeds its hype, it's expectations and will break you. See it whilst you can in cinema."

There are a couple problems with it and therefore cannot match it's effortless predecessor. Infinity War is probably my favorite MCU movie. Not only was it able to create a balance of characters similar to Lord of The Rings, but it also entered uncharted territory for a superhero movie - the protagonists lost.Endgame is focused exclusively on this loss at the cost of an effective first act, which is quite slow to be honest. Not a lot happens and things have to get to speed by the second act. The pacing isn't so bad, either. The second and third acts are very well built and the final battle could also be comparable to the maelstrom battle in Pirates 3 or even some major battles from LOTR.The 3-hour runtime is also necessary. Most of that time is usually well spent or time thrown away. It depends on what perspective you see it from, but there's no denying that the movie felt more like 2 hours than 3.In conclusion, Avengers: Endgame is a masterpiece. It does have it's flaws and isn't any better than Infinity War, but it's still really, really good."

But Endgame was pretty close.","After leaving the cinema, my friends and I were in awe, discussing our very favorite parts and maybe some minor dislikes we found.Personally, this movie did so many things right, it's very easy to foresee minor things that might have bothered someone. Cinematography was incredible, special effects at some moments were so good it blown my mind, actors were able to really shine with so many emotional moments. Maybe my only point which didn't hit the spot 100% was the music. Maybe I was just stunned by the movie itself that the music went by without me noticing it. That I will be able to judge after watching it again.What I believe to be the biggest strength of this movie might be how many people it can reach and what it does to the viewer. One of my friends jumped in his seat at specific moments out of excitement and joy, others shared a glance at their neighbor seat with a truly "WTF" face and without looking directly to check, I bet some also shed a tear or two either from laughing or being emotionally hit.But the one thing I'm most thankful for is one moment. I've never experienced something like this before. There was no music in this specific scene and no words were spoken, there was no sound from someone coughing, grabbing some popcorn, heck not even a single breath was to hear. It was a terrific, yet beautiful absolute silence to tribute the very moment that was shown.That, I will never forget."

The Russo brothers once again bring an epic showdown with our favorite heroes. The movie isn't necessarily a cult classic what with it breaking box office records and what not, but wrapping up ten years of relatable, colorful, and well-directed action films is certainly something to go for. It's hard telling exactly what will happen next when it comes to the future success of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but it's likely not going to top the current momentum for a while, if ever. Overall, the film has a fairly complex yet understandable storyline and is pretty unpredictable at times. It should remain quite a classic to MCU fans like myself and not just Marvel fans in general (i.e. comic books, Stan Lee, etc.)."

2,1-Nov-03,bob the moo,39,85,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"A reasonably enjoyable romp through recent history and pop culture  any more than that and it's a crass conservative message (spoilers)","Sitting at a bus stop, Forrest Gump starts to take to those around him and tells a story of his life to date.  His is a fairly unremarkable life that spans recent history.  It begins with his childhood in Alabama and his growth from humble beginnings to take part in many memorable events in recent American history.I saw this when it came out and have seen it several times since then.  I haven't reviewed it until now because I've always felt that my views of this film were pushed one way or another by a) it winning lots of Oscars and b) everyone hammering it in comparison to Pulp Fiction.  It should be judged on it's own merits, so I watched it yesterday in an attempt to do that.  I felt that I could view it in one of two ways  either as a comical walk through recent history or as a message.As a special effects driven walk through recent history it is actually quite enjoyable.  It does get a bit tiresome to see Forrest meet one president after another, or invent popular songs/slogans/tee shirts/ bumper stickers etc but it still works quite well.  The subplot of his love for Jenny doesn't work as well in this context and actually serves only to slow things down a little and to create the cheesy climax to the film.  However this subplot is the basis for the film's `message'.  Jenny and Forrest both start out in the same place.  Forrest works hard without questioning anything, sure he gets some tough breaks but his dogged efforts eventually work out for him.  Jenny, on the other hand, gets involved in the other culture of the times  be it political rebellion, drugs, music, extramarital sex etc. Her fate is less than Forrest's  she dies and realises on her death dead that she should have just been clean cut like Forrest.  This side of the film smacks rather heavily  first of all it is all too sentimental but, more importantly, it is a clear attack on the counter cultures and a condemnation of those that are part of them.Of course the film's humour means that the two extremes of Forrest and Jenny are also played for laughs so even a flag burning, drug user may be won over by the film before it starts to deliver it's message drop and drop.  I tried just to enjoy the comic side of the film but it wasn't enough to fill the 2 hour plus run time and I started looking at the sub plot  and didn't like what I saw.The cast are all pretty OK.  I don't think for a moment that Hanks deserved his Oscar, but there's nothing more can be said of that.  He does do good work to play his `dumb' character so well but it shouldn't really have won no matter who else it was up against.  Penn is OK but only has to play `bad' for most of the film.  Sinise is pretty good value and his character is a mix, with the bitterness writ large on his life.  Williamson plays another `dumb' character but does OK and Field is alright as Forrest's Mom.  To be honest the cast all match the tone of the film  all good people who just keep plodding along and get good results.Overall I should take the film to be praise of an America where even those with 75 IQ's can make it, however this simply isn't true.  What remains once this is rejected is the comedy of seeing Hanks inserted into archive footage (to mostly amusing effect) and a crass and obvious attack on those who would go against whatever America stands for.  It's worth a watch but the crude message and effect driven humour simply didn't help me understand where all those Oscars came from."

2,1-Apr-02,sychonic,18,37,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"Simple, basic, and true","I just recently saw this movie again, hadn't seen it since it first came out in '94.  Maybe everyone else figured it out, but I suddenly realized  that the whole movie really was about "stupid is as stupid does," the phrase he repeats every time he's accused of being dim.  Forrest Gump is obviously not a bright guy, but the movie seems to say that that doesn't matter very much because he makes the right choices.  His decisions are smart even if he isn't.  And his decisions are, of course, strangely conservative, strange insofar as the movie comes out of ultraliberal Hollywood.  He plays sports, has an old fashioned sense of chivalry (i.e. beating up anyone who abuses his lifelong love Jenny), he goes to war, he believes in God, starts up a small business, works hard, loves his mother, has a deep sense of honor (giving over half the proceeds of "Bubba Gump" to the family of his deceased friend) and, strangest of all, is a white male from the south portrayed in a positive light.  Contrapose this with Jenny, who is obviously very bright, very smart and makes every wrong move one could make ("stupid is as stupid does" again comes to mind).  She's promiscuous, a drug user, suicidal, falls in with the anti-war inanity of the SDS and Black Panthers, parties hard at discos during the seventies, and ultimately ends up dying of AIDS, never mentioned, but the implication is of course there.  The movie is a tour through American history of course, but I don't think the special effects detract from the basic simplicity of the story.  It is basically a morality story.  Not a very deep or complex one, but just very simple--do the right things, and your life will turn out okay. There aren't very many of these movies made anymore, and so it's somewhat satisfying that this one was, and that it was so successful. It's as if American society had finally had its fill of beautiful alienated youngsters who rebel, do drugs, hate their parents and act like all around jerks (see American Beauty or Cruel Intentions for examples).  Gump isn't the best movie ever made, but it's a strong one, one very much worth seeing, and seeing again to be honest.  "Stupid is as stupid does" may not be poetry or very deep, but it ends up being true, and more than enough to fill up a movie, and make you feel good as the feather floats up into the air at the end."

2,23-Jul-02,hernan_amado,17,35,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"Over-rated and disappointing!",""Spoilers" I must start by writing that I do not like this movie at all. Even though it began well I thought it became dull quite quickly because of the many uninteresting and pointless turns in the plot.We see Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) sitting on a bench talking to a person who sits next to him about his life. When Forrest was young he had a lot of problems because he was a handicapped person. He meets a pretty girl on the school bus and begins to fall in love with her. When some envious and mean school children are chasing him he discovers he can run, finally overcoming his physical disability. This scene was amazing because it shows that people can overcome any diseases by having faith in themselves. Forrest Gump was a brave boy who tried to run, even when it was nearly impossible for him. That was an interesting beginning. However, when he grows up and graduates from college this movie turns out to be awful, as the only thing he does is keep talking about his life as a football player, as a runner and, ridiculously as a soldier, he's inexplicably the best soldier.  Forrest Gump seems to believe he's very interesting, that his achievements in life are extremely important and valuable to us, but they aren't. For instance, we see him getting medals and many other things, but I really didn't feel interested in what he received because he seems to be so arrogant, thinking he's the best person in the world. I didn't find myself quite absorbed in the film because I didn't feel amazed by all the achievements he got. Why does he tell it? He only tells people about his achievements to show off, pretending he's a great person! He is happily and arrogantly seated on a bench telling his life to whoever sits next to him. I didn't care what he said, because he only driveled.After the disappointing climax comes the original ending, which I enjoyed because it wasn't predictable. I never thought Forrest's wife would die. She was sick but I didn't like the way she died. It seems that the writers didn't have anything interesting to add, other than a simple disease to get her out of the story. I also liked it when Forrest and his wife had a child whom they also named Forrest, but I thought the final scene where the child gets onto a bus is interesting because it's somewhat unpredictable; it looked like the whole story would begin again and I do not want to see the same insipid story again because I already went through Gump's life. I certainly do not want to go through his son's life. That'd be more grief!I do not understand why it received an academy award for best picture. I haven't seen many of 1994's movies, but I'm sure there are more inspiring and interesting movies than this one. A good example would be `Shawshank Redempion' that unbelievably lost the Oscar for best picture!Overall, this movie is not outstanding. There are many unnecessary and long scenes such as his life in the army, his life as a rich person his life as a person who waits for a bus and finally his life as a runner. I'm sure this could have been a shorter movie. If it had been this way it wouldn't be so annoying. I found the movie far-fetched because I don't think people can run as much as he did, and I don't think people can be so successful without working hard for their future. When do we see Forrest willing to be a successful person? He only did what his family and girlfriend told him to do. He was never willing to be a successful person. I know it's just a movie so I don't worry about it. All the performances in this movie were somewhat believable, especially Sally Field who was an excellent loving mother. I felt sad when she died, since her character was very caring to her son, as some mothers are to their children. Sally Field's performance was convincing, but I didn't find Tom Hanks deserving of an academy award, because he gave an unbelievably simple and unchallenging performance. His performance in 'The Green Mile' was better. 5/10"

Sign in to vote.,"Retard Yourself With Retro-Culture!","If you're like me you hate to think; even worse is thinking about history- so much moral ambiguity, so much perspective and bothersome shades of grey... isn't there a movie out there that can assure me that everything that happened during the latter-half of the twentieth century was Just Fine- all while deafening me with jukebox favorites?Now you can! Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks proudly present "Forrest Gump" a left-wing work of right-wing propaganda that boldly proclaims the mentally retarded are not just AS GOOD as you and me, but better! And as a result, American Heroes! Forrest's IQ is charted at seventy, which means he will stay boyishly naive until the script calls for him to suddenly make a profound declaration for the Oscar clip: "I'm not a smart man... but I know what love is." Whatchyou talking' bout, Forrest? This is retro-active re-writing of pop-culture disguised as American history designed to make us all feel better about not understanding the exact details of the Watergate break-in or the black panther party. Forrest floats through life with the gravity- and substance- of a feather, tossing off sickeningly-pointless nothingisms: "Life is like a box of chocolates..." No, it isn't.It really, really isn't.His erstwhile girlfriend goes through every cliché of cultural extremism (flower child, disco burnout, AIDS corpse) to lecture the audience about the dangers of Actually Being Involved In Something! We'll be much better off if we listen to Mama like Forrest and dip our toes in the water only for the sake of a digitally-enhanced photo-opportunity. (Love the way you moved Lennon's lips to set up your clunker of a joke... that took a lot of class!) And finally the mystery of who taught Elvis to dance has been solved- it was a crippled simpleton, and not the butler as previously suspected.But the adventures don't end there: Zemeckis (Greek for arrogant-ignorant) wants us to believe that this Drooling Dandy was an integral part of EVERY significant historical event: Gump meets JFK, carves Mount Rushmore, builds the sun, performs open-heart surgery! Forrest saves a fellow soldier during The War (good) who happens to be black (better) and inherits a shrimping boat (obviously)... we meet Gary Sinise's Lieutenant Dan who has the gall to question Gump's ability; for this his legs are blown off and he's doomed to an entire life of pain and suffering. Don't fear the retard...All of Forrest's toothless adventures are washed down with some of the most over-played soundtrack songs of the era, until the Dumb One takes to the road for a series of painful gags, increasing exponentially in stupidity until finally he's left with the motherless son he never wanted nor could possibly raise. (It's the next best thing to Immaculate Conception.) Are we vomiting yet?Ultimately, Forrest Gump proves that Tom Hanks was so good in "Philadelphia" that we weren't finished giving him Oscars, and the movie's other trophies only go to prove that we're the very lemmings They think we are, preferring glossy bile over thought-provoking quality.This is "Pop-Culture for Dummies" masquerading as American History and quality film. Will rot your brain like crack-cocaine.GRADE: F"

2,19-Mar-13,kechhh,1,1,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"The Best in All of Us","A great comedy and a great and touching drama. I felt this movie achieved a perfect balance of comedy and drama and depth. A balance that pure drama and pure comedies often fail to achieve. To me, this film was more touching than movies that were intended to be mainly touching turned out to be. In that, Forrest Gump was a masterpiece.You see the small things he does and the greatness he inspires and causes in people all around him without having much intelligence. This helps remind us that no matter what kind of person we are, no matter what physical or mental capabilities we have, we still can cause so much greatness in people's lives both intentionally and in ways that we don't even know.The movie is also inspiration in that you see a picked on persevere and either not notice or completely ignore the ridicule and setbacks he faces. He takes it and he runs as hard as he can.His plain and complete niceness reminds us that it doesn't take much to be nice and cause positive change in other people's lives.Also, the bus scene setups were great, enabling the great flashback style and narration storytelling that made it great. It was finally great to see in the end someone who actually stayed to care and listen and skip their bus.Great movie. One of my favorite."

Sign in to vote.,"(spoiler warning) Forrest and Forrest Jr. should get a blood test...","...because when you have unprotected sex with an HIV positive woman, and that woman has a child, you run a sort of, well, "high risk" of receiving HIV (especially Forrest Jr).  I guess "Jennay" forgot to tell that to Forrest before she died.  GET TESTED, FORREST, and RUN!I don't mean to be abrasive, but after a second viewing of "Forrest Gump," I noticed this glaring omission.  Yes, it is the 1980s, so much less was known about the disease, but the filmmakers should have included something to let the audience know whether the Gump family would share the same fate as Jenny.  To me, this is a giant hole in the film, and one that needed to be addressed.And regarding the film itself...Personally, I'm in the middle; I don't love or hate "Forrest Gump."  The fact that it is overrated drove many to an extreme dislike for the film, yet some feel it is a masterwork.  To me, it is neither terrible or great.  It is a pretty good movie--enjoyable and humorous, but it is sometimes sappy, sentimental and contrived.  Some portions are great and some are poor.  In the end, the good outweighed the bad slightly, and I came away satisfied but not totally pleased.  Zemeckis has made better films (try "Back to the Future," "Contact," and even "Cast Away"), and so has Hanks.I recommend "Forrest Gump" marginally because it has a good heart and a good, interesting story...but it also has its fair share of flaws.  "Pulp Fiction" and especially "The Shawshank Redemption" deserved the Academy Awards, but oh well...don't complain over something so trivial...awards don't mean THAT much."Forrest Gump" can have a 7/10 from me."

As for Tom Hanks, I thought any other actor could've acted this role, it's easy to act "retarded" and to speak weird.  The movie became long after a while, I wanted it to end.  It's not because I wasn't liking it but they could've made it shorter.  *Next paragraph is full of SPOILERS* The woman "Jenny" I didn't like her at all.  To me, she used Forrest all along.  First, she should've never accepted to take his medal of honor the first time (although later she gave it back).  Second, she left him many times and didn't want to marry him. And then, she took him back & wanted to marry him ONLY AFTER she learned that she was sick.  IMO, she married him just so that he takes care of her & son.  I just thought she didn't really love him and only acted in her own interest.Anyways, it's a good movie if you like the type."

2,7-Jan-00,dust-7,0,2,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"Classic Film!","Spoilers!First, it was a classic film, which should have won all the awards it did. Second - it could have been better.Gump is a tall tale, a cliched tour, of America from the 1950s through the 1980s. One man, a slightly retarded individual, named Forrest Gump, from the deep south of course, bumps into and/or is the cause of innumerable public events and incidents, decade after decade; each spiked with appropriate pop background music, from Hendrix to Fleetwood Mac. It's a bit strained to fit as many pop culture references into the life of one man, as with the back to back t-shirt episodes of the running man, Gump. But, generally, it works - except:Except that as with any tall tale, the how, why, and wherefore is always glossed over. How could he be so utterly unaware of himself and his place in publicized events, year after year? How could he run coast to coast and back again? and is that considered interesting (it's a slow point of the film). It's a joke, here, pathos there. It's a laugh at the Black Panthers - shown as ignorant, tedious and boring demagogues, who lecture a man who, under both enemy and friendly fire saved the life of his best friend, a black man - a laugh at the SDS - shown as basically a trendy, superficial and messed up Bohemian - the March on Washington crowd - 'offing the pigs' while hastily presenting a man who utterly opposes their agenda - the Mr. Goodbar disco set - bunch of licentious druggies, and no more - and so on and so forth. For those whom the anti-war crowd and Mr. Goodbar were heroes, this film must be like a knife in the side. But it's not really anti-liberal, or conservative, so much as it remains a tall tale and a platform for almost sketch comedy, but based on what the writers knew or esteemed, which would seem to be liberal causes mostly - so those are what wind up getting skewered.The pathos is suggested in Gump as the 'little child' of Scripture - to be as the child, to accept others, to be uncritical, to always believe, and the like. He never holds a grudge. He always want to believe the best of others. He transforms Dan's life, and presents the most emotional moment of the whole film when Dan comes to visit for the wedding, between Gump and his doomed wife, Jenny - and is able to walk on artificial limbs, obviously happy to be alive.However, Gump isn't really a child. A while his acceptance of others is laudable, the reason is still that of incompetence. He literally doesn't know enough not to be naive. He doesn't have a choice - and it's not a choice he makes, therefore. Add to the fact that his entire life is really a series of screenwriter's jokes. He simply cannot appreciate what he's done, or why. It's all a blur of events which he relates in the most alienated, and disconnected fashion. It's only to contradict the story so far when running man, Gump, remarks on the beauty of a mountain reflecting on a lake below, or the momentary pause from the rain in Vietnam. It's like two different people, but the simple, and gentle man, not really involved in his own life, is the one seen through most of the film. Real people who have mental disabilities, supposedly as Gump, could appreciate the sunset over a lake, and could express a far wider range of emotion than the emotionally stunted Gump. Had they made the simple man more aware of himself, more human, it would have been a much better film upon repeated viewing.Ultimately, it could be the writers present a message they didn't intend to. Gump is great not just because good things happen to him, even in desperate situations, but because he has not convinced himself, as the boomers around him have in this film, that life is not only not like a box of chocolates, because there must be some planning and goal setting in life, but that life is just one long stumble after another through cheap slogans and debilitating drugs. One stumbles through nature, friends, wealth, awards, and accomplishment. Thinking itself so much smarter, the other just stumbles, and is not even to be pitied for it. It's a message film, to be sure. But the message can get lost in the humorous tall tale, because in that sense, it's almost two films, instead of one."

GREAT MOVIE","It seems that when a story is told on film, the most difficult thing to do is NOT use a narrative voice over. Sometimes film makers get lazy or lack creativity and decide that the viewer would be lost without the narrative, so they feel trapped into adding the story-telling voice over (or even worse, long paragraphs scrolling between each act). It is especially hard to avoid when covering a long time span. While being informative, to me it can dumb a movie down. This is the ONLY complaint I have with this whole movie. Beyond the small annoyance with the voiced over narration, I thought this was a near perfect movie, combining every element of great modern movie making, from beautiful scenery, to comedic genius, to action, to romance, and on to gripping drama. Further, this movie contained a great cast.***************Spoiler Warning*************** My gripe about the narration being voiced over in order to inform the audience is tempered by the creativity which was used to present the narration. It wasn't your typical story telling of an elderly person wisely reflecting on the life he or she had lived, telling the story to the audience as if we were his or her grandchild. The narration was brilliantly inserted as Forrest met different people at the bus stop, giving us even more insight into this man. He is a simple, friendly and interesting man that wants people to know about him and the love and pain he has endured through the years. He didn't even realize the impact his life had on the culture of the past 2 decades.  Or more interestingly, maybe he DID know what he was saying and just PLAYED dumb. After all, stupid is as stupid does.  Maybe Forrest Gump was a genius (as his drill sergeant put it) and just wanted us to think his life was more important than it really was.  Or how about this, maybe his life really did have this huge cultural impact and he was just being modest.  It's incredible when you think about the number of possible explanations as to why Forrest seemed to so quickly spit out the grand story of his life and it's impact on the world without much regard to how important it REALLY was. He seemed to trivialize each major impact his life had on the world while maintaining his focus on his love for Jennie, his mother's wisdom, or his friend Ltnt Dan.  This creativity, along with the layers it brings to Forrest's persona is why I am able to forgive the lazy approach to story telling in the narrative.It was also interesting to me how some holes were closed, but left to the viewers imagination exactly what happened... most notably Jen's disease. Did she die from AIDS? Did she pass it to her son? Just an interesting tidbit, IMO.In summary, this was a near perfect movie. I believe this movie will hold up for years to come and eventually will be considered a classic. I give this movie a rating of 9 out of 10 points.If you like good music (especially 60's and 70's), get this soundtrack. It's the best movie soundtrack made, for my taste anyway."

Sign in to vote.,"Forest Gump Review","Forest Gump Review Forest Gump is always running away from danger, bullies, football, and sometimes just because. Running helps face many ups and downs in his life. As the protagonist trying to find love he can't get it because the love of his life can't see past his simple mind until it's too late. While Forest is achieving great success in his life by becoming a football star, a army hero, a ping pong champion, a shrimp boat captain, and a nationally known runner, he still wants Jenny. The film was produced in 1994 by Paramount Studios and Steve Tisch, Steve Starkey, Wendy Finerman. Forest who is born simple in Alabama during the period of segregation in our country and he has many obstacles as a child because people refer him as stupid, but his mother tells him he is not and to not to listen to them. He also has to have "magic legs" to help walk better, and he learns at an early age that he can run anywhere faster than he can walk. The movie moves thru history as Forest ages, and takes him to Vietnam and many other great adventures. He finds a lifelong friend along the way in his army Lieutenant, and Forest is always thinking about Jenny his childhood friend, wishing to be with her. The effects set the mood of each scenes and capture the times especially during the war scenes with the music and the sounds of violence. The songs played in each time sequence of the movie help you establish what period Forest is in. The theme is you never know what you are going to get in life and you will never be prepared so you need to make the best of everything. Hope that along the way that best always happens and try not to get off track. In my opinion this movie is one of the best movies that I have seen. It's got a good story, good music, and you the message is one that everyone should try for. I rate this movie a 10 out of a 10."

Not only does it have a great plot and love story, but lots of historical context throughout. . It covers, wars, influential people at the time, famous people who have passed away, and how they impacted the world can be tied to the movie It starts' out in the late 50's and moves on through the late 80's, covering most major historical events. The movie starts out by an older Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) sitting at Savannah, GA bus stop telling his life story to the fellow bus riders. Some are very attentive, some indifferent and some are simply in disbelief listening to the stranger tell them of his accomplishments, even though he doesn't view them that way. Forrest, a kind and faithful soul, grew up in Greenbow, Alabama in the early 60's, he has a low I.Q., which leaves him very prejudiced with the schools and other residents of his town. Along with the low I.Q., he has leg braces for most of his early childhood leaving people to believe he was going to be crippled for life.His mother( Sally Field) teaches him the ways of life and leaves him to create his own destiny, despite the challenges she knew he would face because of his mentally capacity. He doesn't have any friends except a young girl named Jenny Curran (Robin Wright), whom he loves from the second he lays eyes on her. Forrest and Jenny get into a altercation with a group of older boys from their school, and he breaks free of legs braces only to reveal that he is lightning fast, which leads to a college scholarship. Forrest and Jenny were inseparable until Jenny decides to run away from her abusive father and go travel the United States with a band of hippies.After Jenny left their home town, Forrest enlists in the United States Army, only to be drafted to Vietnam. There he makes friends with a black man named Bubba, and LT. Dan. After many weeks together, Bubba convinces Forrest to open up a shrimping company once they are discharged from the army. Later on the platoon is attacked and Forrest has to run back into the chaos to rescue his fellow friends, Bubba dies from his wounds, and LT. Dan lost his legs, but survives thanks to Forrest. He received the Congressional Medal of Honor from the President. Forrest then goes on to be a famous ping pong champion and ends up winning thousands of dollars to help in invest in his and Bubba's Shrimp Company, Bubba Gump, which then becomes a giant multi-million dollar company.Forrest is asked to speak at the Washington Monument about his life in Vietnam, since he was awarded the Medal of Honor and Jenny happens to be there protesting against the war. They end up going back to Savannah, GA because Forrest's mother is dying of cancer, and she was like the mother Jenny never had. Along his travels Forrest meets, Elvis Presley, John Lennon, John F Kennedy and many more. This movie is very rich historical context, it also is showing the audience that no matter where you started in life, you can always be the best you can be if you just try your hardest. I think this movie should be seen by every generation of young adults, because it's so rich a full of the past that is captured so well in the movie. The historical context just translate so much better than reading it out of a book, because of how the main character and his fellow friends have to deal with the problems of the world. I really loved how even though Forrest is so innocent, you really get a feel of how people in the 60's and 70's felt about segregation, their government, about the Vietnam War, and how the government evolves from the 50's all the way to the 80's. The movie has Forrest walk through the first desegregated school and help a young African-American Woman as she is walking almost what seems like hell on earth for her with screaming white protesters. Forrest also stumbles upon the Watergate scandal and actually calls the police on them. If you get the chance, watch the movie, if you have already seen it, go see it again"

Sign in to vote.,"My Review Forrest","The movie starts off with Forrest Gump (played by Tom Hanks) at a bus stop telling his life story to all the strangers that sit next to him on the bench. As new strangers sit on the bench with Forrest, we get a different decade of Forrest's' life. Forrest's story starts when he had to wear leg braces as a kid and how the other kids teased him and bullied him, but Forrest's mother Mrs. Gump (played by Sally Field) tells him that stupid is as stupid does. Those words help Forrest to tolerate the bullies. Forrest's mother is determined to enroll Forrest in a regular school but she is told that his IQ is below the learning level and a special school would be more appropriate. Instead of listening to the school officials, she enrolls him a regular school against the odds and his first day of school he meets Jenny Curran (played by Robin Wright) and falls madly in love with her. As Forrest would say, "Jenny and I are like peas and carrots." Forrest had two special friends that he met in the military, Benjamin Buford "Bubba" Blue (played by Mykelti Williamson) and Second Lieutenant Dan Taylor (played by Gary Sinise). Forrest also finds out he has a son Forrest Gump Jr. (played by Haley Joel Osment) that he later raises.There are several themes in Forrest Gump. The first theme would be dealing with death and that death is a part of life and we all have to deal with it. Forrest had to deal with the death of his good friend Bubba, his mother, and Jenny. Another theme is not to give up. Forrest deals with so many obstacles throughout his life and by him being mentality and physically challenged, but he always pulls through those challenges by remembering things his other taught him. Forrest dealt with the legs braces and being bullied by other kids and he dealt with the rejection from Jenny not wanting be his girlfriend or to marry him. The last theme would be accepting yourself for who you are and value your own personal worth despite the odds. Forrest's mother taught him to love, always be pleasant and polite and to remember that life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get. The movie Radio would be similar to Forest Gump. Radio (played by Cuba Gooding Jr.) deals with similarities as far as being raised by a single mother, dealing with death, along with physical and mental disabilities.The lighting in the movie for the themes was very appropriate, for example when Forrest spoke with his mother the day before her passing the lighting had a serenity essence almost as if to state Mrs. Gump would have eternal life in heaven. When Forrest's lost his very best buddy Bubba, the lighting was dark and gloomy, but I'm sure that was due to the two being in the middle of a war. If you pay close attention the lighting changes when Forrest takes pride in himself and practically referring to the part when Forrest is asked to mow and service the lawn at the university he attended. He was mighty proud.Forrest Gump was raised with values and morals and the movie portrays those values and morals, but it also makes a statement how America needs to embrace those values and morals."

Sign in to vote.,"Film Review","Forrest Gump Film Review Forrest Gump, directed by Robert Zemeckis, is undoubtedly one of the best movies of all time. Staring Tom Hanks the movie takes you through the life of Forrest Gump. As a child Forest was picked on of the leg braces he had to wear. His best friend was a girl by the name of Jenny Curran. Forrest later develops into a college football star for the University of Alabama. After college Forrest enlists in the US Army. While in training he meets another best friend Bubba. Bubba and Forrest are sent to fight in the Vietnam War. They are assigned to First Lieutenant Dan. While out on a patrol the platoon takes heavy fire from Vietnam solders. Both Lieutenant Dan and Bubba are injured during the firefight. Forrest in an act of bravery goes into the jungle time and time again and pulls his injured comrades from danger saving many lives. As a result of is courageous act Forrest is awarded the Medal of Honor. After this Forrest gets a shrimping boat along with Lieutenant Dan. Later Forrest runs into Jenny, he proposes but she turns him down initially but later comes around to the idea. While recovering from his injury sustained at war Forrest becomes a phenomenal ping pong player and competes against China. John Lennon and Forrest appear on a talk show together. John Lennon, after his trip to China was inspired to write the song "Imagine". This brings me to the sound track and music through out the film Forrest Gump. Early in the movie Elvis comes to the Gump's guesthouse where he encounters Forrest. Despite having the leg braces on, Forrest is able to move his hips to "Hound Dog". The dance moves then become Elvis' signature moves. One track that is featured is "For What Its Worth" by Buffalo Springfield. This song is played as Forrest and his platoon travel through Vietnam. This song has also been connected with the Vietnam conflict and the transition to the counter culture in the 60s. Another song in Forrest Gump is "Free Bird" by Lynyrd Skynyrd. This song is heard s a Drug addicted Jenny climbs to the ledge of her hotel balcony as if to jump to her death. The famous guitar solo builds as she climbs to the edge the suspense of the scene is matched with the guitar opening up. There are several instances of mise-en-scene, this helps the viewer feel a strong connection with Forrest. Forrest through out the film has a pretty consistent good attitude. However there are some low points through out the movie and the director uses mise-en-scene to capture these emotions. Once when he is struggling in Vietnam after a firefight. Another time when Forrest is running around the country and hits a wall and realizes this isn't what he wants to do anymore. During happier moments the director uses a low contrast look, which gives a mood of happiness and contentment. There is also a presence of shots that help feel emotion for example at the end of the film when Forrest is looking down at Jenny's grave. The camera looks at Forrest from a low angle and captures the emotion that Forrest feels for jenny."

I watched it and finished up crying I didn't know why i still wonder why I cried at it but now i realize it was pathos for that character which caused my tears. Back then, as i still am now I was popular, I didn't have great friend but i was/am well-liked (not sounding big-headed I hope), and now since becoming a part-time cinephile I realised the reason I love movies and love this movie was that it was taking me to new surroundings and as the tagline suggests see the world through the eyes of Forrest Gump. I did that and enjoyed that insight and so enjoyed this film. I'm not gonna pap on about the plot because i always do that and I'm sick of writing spoilers all the time. I don't really think that this view will urge anyone to love this film but i want to say thislaters"

Sign in to vote.,"and that's all I have to say about that","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** *****SPOILERS FOLLOWING*****Forrest Gump is an epic journey of a movie.Narrated throughout by Tom Hanks,who,in what has to be his best acting role ever,plays the gullible yet wholly lovable Forrest Gump. The movie begins with a thirty-something Forrest sitting on a park bench waiting for the number 7 bus.A feather falls at his feet and he picks it up and puts it in an old book he is carrying.This simple visual moment is the basis for the movie,it is a physical metaphor for lifes journey,and for the next 142 minutes we are voyeurs into the trials and tribulations of this simple-minded man from Greenbow Alabama. Our insight into Forrests life begins with him needing a contraption to help him walk when he is all of six or seven.A portly Doctor explains to the boys mother,played by Sally Field,that:Well...his legs are fine Mrs Gump,but his back is as crooked as a politician.And so poor Forrest has to wear steel leg braces that look simply 'chaotic'.The screenplay utilises this device to create a simply brilliant scene where Forrest seems to teach a young Elvis Presley his now infamously risque dance moves while staying in their mansion-like homestay.Forrest narrates this from the park bench to total strangers who are also waiting for a bus.He talks in a manner that suggests he thinks it's no big thing.His indifference causes disbelief in some of the strangers as he continues on with the story of his remarkable life. On the bus to school one day(when he is still very young) he meets a young girl named Jenny,who,in time becomes his one true love and an integral character in the story.'Me and Jenny was like peas and carrots' explains Forrest.'We did everything together'. Forrest gets older and becomes a football star after discovering his talent for running,and discovers that,in their late teenage years,he and Jenny aren't that close anymore.Having had an abusive childhood Jenny has trouble with commitment and stability,but knows what she wants from life.In a poignant and somewhat humourous scene in her secular school dorm she explains:I want to be a singer Forrest,like Joan Biaz.on a stage,just me and my guitar'. Forrests eventful life continues on and we see him involved in a scene where there is racial tension at his school and where,because of his achievements at football,he gets to meet President John F Kennedy.Both of these scenes are unique as Tom Hanks was actually added into the actual footage of these events as they really happened by computer technology.Both are extremely amusing scenes. The Vietnam War erupts and Forrest is conscripted.Just before he goes he finds Jenny singing in a seedy nightclub and rescues her from a group of obnoxious men,for which she is not impressed.She tells him she wants him to leave her alone.'I'm going to Vietnam...Jenny.I'll write you everyday'.And being a man of his word he does,amidst the graphic and relentless turmoil of the war.Gary Sinise puts in a star performance as Lt.Dan,a wily but genuinely nice character. Forrest befriends a negro by the name of Beauford Blue,who is affectionately called Bubba.His obsession is shrimp,and all he does is talk about it.His dream when leaving the army was to start a shrimping business.He asks Forrest if he'd like to be his partner and he obliges.Then one day the platoon is wiped out.Lt.Dan loses his legs and Bubba dies in Forrests arms.Recovering in hospital after being 'shot in the butTOCKS' Forrest learns that none of his letters to Jenny ever reached her-she had been travelling from city to city doing drugs and generally mixing with the wrong people. Forrest then becomes a professional table-tennis player while Lt.Dan,now in a wheelchair wallows in self pity.The two reunite one day in New York when Lt.Dan finds out Forrest was awarded the Congressional medal of honour for bravery after saving his companys lives in Nam.Forrests charmed and simple view on life eventually leads Lt.Dan to change his own outlook and together they begin trawling the ocean for shrimp in a boat called 'Jenny'.They succeed in their venture. Forrests life is not all wine and caviar though(or should that be shrimp?)as his mother passes away from cancer.Jenny returns but she is an emotional mess.Out walking one day they end up at her old home.Crying she throws stones at the now derelict house before collapsing onto the ground.Forrest narrates:'I guess sometimes there just ain't enough rocks'.Their relationship stays rocky,then one morning after making love,Jenny runs away.Forrest is devastated and takes up running-clear across the country! The film drifts back to the present day where Forrest is still waiting for his bus.After a disbeliever walks away laughing an elderly lady tells him she thinks it was a lovely story.Forrest explains he's on his way to see Jenny,the lady then tells him he doesn't need to catch the bus;the place he is looking for is only four blocks away. Forrest is reunited with Jenny who now seems to have her life in order.But there is a surprise ahead,she has a child.Forrests child.Initially shocked Forrest soon accepts this new responsibility as Jenny reveals she is dying,(we are left to assume from A.I.D.S)Inevitabley she dies and Forrest assumes the role of Father to young Forrest(Hayley Joel Osmont.) The movie ends at it began,the feather escaping from the book and gently flirting with the breeze up into an azure Alabama sky.Truly a magnificent movie.10/10."

All the comments of these people manifested one of those two. They just don't understand that the plot of Forrest Gump is almost totally figurative! I really don't get you people, Forrest Gump is not only unique, it EXQUISITE, it surpasses everything a good movie can be! If this isn't a 10+/10 movie, I don't know what is.When other movies poke you STRAIGHT IN THE FACE some reprimands, or moral lessons, or "confrontations with God", or personal life journeys, or dark sides of the world such as war, child sexual abuse, drugs etc., you grimace and say "damn, another unoriginal preaching piece of crap". But when you get Forrest Gump, the most genius movie ever that servers you all the above mentioned plus much much more in the most original, creative, imaginative, emotions-evoking way, you cavil and scorn it, say it is boring, implausible, ridiculous celebration of stupidity, has insidious offensive messages... Come on!The superiority of this movie is how it makes a fictitious, fantastic, improbable story almost a believable one. But let's say you don't believe, ok. Then you go and look for messages, and what do you find? Right-wing/American Dream propaganda? Patronizing southern/black/rebel people? Go on, dig some more, miss the real gist. Miss the opportunity to see what's our world like through the eyes of an innate virtuous man lacking grudge, greed and falsity, miss true love, honesty, loyalty, friendship, miss the force to overcome personal catastrophes, miss the different meanings of life, destiny, miss the MOST ORIGINAL CHRONOLOGY of the well-known American history events... and much more. Make fun of the inspiring scenes such as the cross-country running (& many more), the excellent scenes of Forrest's effects on the history, the funny scenes such as the smiley-face, or other exciting ones... if I continue, I'll write here the whole script! Every scene is brilliant, just BRILLIANT! I for one just can't help myself from admiring the one who created this story, this plot. it IS unbelievable. Unbelievably amazing.I won't detail my feelings and opinions about the movie, it's plot and symbols, it would be too much. I just hope all the people who patronize both the character of Forrest Gump and the spectators who loved the movie, will find also their EQ (Emotional Quotient), and place it somewhere beside their mighty IQ. Seriously, give it another chance from a different point of view. Please try.P.S: I can accept (just to accept, not to understand, not to agree) the opinions of those who disliked the movie - but the only one I just can't GET is the claim that Tom Hanks got an easy oscar. I don't know whether or not it's easier to act retarded, but I think this role was one of the hardest ever, and Tom Hanks has done it superbly! Even when Hanks isn't talking, his facial impressions are speaking instead (e.g. the can-touch-a-robot scene where he asks about the intelligence of his son).. His performance is just too real to call it acting. Gary Sinise and Robin Wright are magnificent to."

Sign in to vote.,"Perhaps a bit more complex than most would think...","Judging from the box office success, Forrest Gump is a film that has touched many millions of lives. It seems to work on many levels, some of which have been exhaustedly discussed in other opinions here. Shortly after seeing it at the cinema (a decade ago) it occurred to me that the character of Forrest Gump could be regarded as a metaphor for 20th century America. Starting from a difficult childhood, Forrest finds he has outgrown his disability, just as America's economic strength found its feet from 1900 to 1950. His pursuit of Jenny represents the American dream, lost to promiscuity and the moral blight of Vietnam. The death of Forrest's mother represents the passing of "Norman Rockwell's America" (for want of a better expression) and as we all know - a lot of sh** happened in the 70s. That Forrest finds wealth easily represents one of the great myths/truths about 20th century America - the land of opportunity. The parallels are numerous.It might seem a simple film about a simple man, but it's resonance is far from accidental. This film should be compulsory viewing for anyone seeking to understand the psyche of modern America."

This film is a brilliant tale of a man who passes through a series of historical events, unwittingly, however, while trying to find his true love. What I enjoyed most about this film, though, was the way that Forrest was passing through different events without having a clue what was going on. It is the way Forrest is shown mixing in Black and White with historical figures that gets me laughing always. Forrest's great Grandpa was the man who started the KKK. He taught Elvis how to shake. He broke free of his leg braces to run very fast. Got spotted for college football. Joins the All American team, meets JFK and says "I gotta Pee!" Graduates.  Joins the Army. Becomes a Vietnam war hero. Gets the Medal of Honor. Meets the President again. Causes the Watergate Scandal. Becomes a Ping Pong champion, playing in China, and winning! Does a talk show with John Lennon. Becomes a Shrimpin' Tycoon. Becomes a Millionaire. Gets his money invested in "some fruit company, or something" (Apple Mac). Gives a lot of money away. Becomes a lawnmower man. Runs across the country non stop. Invents the Smiley face, and its slogan "Have a Nice Day!". Invents the phrase "S**t happens". Finds his true love, Jenny. Becomes a father. Becomes a widow. Thats a hell of a lot of stuff ,thats why I like this film so much, it has so much to view, and it isn't just the same old boring stuff."

With all that it also did a lot of good history background. I also think that Forrest Gump is a very inspirational movie for anyone. It showed that someone like Forrest Gump can show others what life is all about and also what is important in life. They mention and show many different historical events. One example is the Vietnam War and what things were like there. I think the thing I liked the most is how they made Forrest Gump the character show people that the little things in life are more important. Such examples are being a love and caring person towards your family and friends. I also think a message of keeping promises to the most important people in your life is showed through this morning. That is a very important message."

Sign in to vote.,"An below average man - an extraordinary life!","!!!!!WARNINGS SPOILERS!!!!I have just watched this for perhaps the third or forth time in its entirety and once again found it to be an uplifting experience; I have read various comments on its Academy competition in 1995 which was perhaps the steepest in recent times, comparisons to the book, (which I haven't read). I think though to truly reflect on it on its own merits. It is a simple tale of a simple man's journey through an amazing life. And although it requires a heavy suspension of disbelief, is that not the purpose of such pieces of entertainment? Are we not similarly uplifted when a Big Foot and two Abbot and Costello type robots help to save the galaxy? Or are we not transfixed with the characters of Jackson's LOTRs? The fact is that Forest is a lot less able than most of us yet he seems stumble into these wonderful adventures that through experience perhaps gives him a better level of understanding that we with our higher cranial capacity can't hope to emulate. Right to the last two scenes in which we see Forest having come to terms with the ambivalence losing the love that for so long eluded him, and yet getting to know the love of a son he never knew he had. In essence it's that old classic tale of the underdog. It is one of those old friendly cloaks that we can wrap around us for warmth on a cold night!If any the message perhaps that Bob Zemeckis is aiming for is that many of us go through life missing the good things along the way - the whole film being a metaphor for most people, no matter their place or station in the world, are given a number  of unappreciated blessings. Even that our own more complicated view of the world gives us a tarnished view of it. Where as Forest just does what he feels 'he' should or says exactly what he feels and is encumbered by the need to present himself in a light that requires the approval of his audience. Perhaps that is to philosophical a look at this film but then I am as I said more impressed with ability to entertain, after all is that not the first job of any films, if we were not able to be entertained through fiction perhaps we would sit at home watching CNN and The Discovery Channel. And as the man would say 'that's all I wan't to say about that right now!'As for the technical aspects of Forest Gump, well were do I start. The acting I thought throughout was excellent Hank's portrayal is more than just good, he sucks you in to the story and helps you form a bond with the main character early, and towards the end were most of the Dialog is by way of metronome precision narration (that keeps the timing of the film together) we see Forest running or on his mower or even just sitting around pondering what has gone before, Tom's facial interpretation of this is excellent. The direction is a major triumph for BZ and the supporting cast turn in stellar performances especially Gary Sinise who chemistry with Hanks has been called upon on two subsequent occasions. (Answers on a post card - EZ really!) All this under one of the best soundtracks ever and of course that wonderful Alan Silvestri score!Forest Rocks *****"

So teacher if you read this thank you so much for showing me this movie.But straight to the point, I liked this movie because first of all it wasnt as other movies related to the past, this one had more thing to which you should pay more atention as well as it let you learn some valuable thing about life. For example one of this was the phrase "Life is like a box of chocolate", at first I didn't understand the meaning but after a lot of thinking I got to the answer and it right no body nows our future even us we all get something different and just destiny and god are the ones in charge of it or so that my thought about it.But it not only this thing that took all my atention also the part of "I just feel like running" was another phrase that I wanted to discover its answer but until now I don't find it. Also another thing is that this movie apart from phrases with something behind them show me the true meaning of love and what it is to be in love.But what I am trying to say is that this was one of the best movies I have watched even thought it talked some past history I still liked, I will recommende it to all those peopel that want to learn valuable thing but at the same time enjoy whatching a movie."

Sign in to vote.,"One of the best movies I've ever seen","---WARNING MANY SPOILERS THROUGHOUT THIS REVIEW--- I would have to say that Forrest Gump is one of the best movies I have ever seen. This movie will make you laugh and it will make you cry. The fact that Forrest is telling you his story while sitting at a bus stop is an excellent idea. Tom Hanks is the best possible actor to play Forrest Gump, his caring soul and simple outlook on things is truly touching. He lives an incredible life, and he isn't able to realize it, often causing laughter to result. Gary Sinise is perfect for the role of Lt. Dan. He nails, and steals, each scene he's in, and in my opinion, he steals the movie as well. When you see Lt. Dan walk up with his fiance, close to the end, with his new metal legs, it brings me to tears. So does the scene when Lt. Dan has finally accepted what happened, isn't angry anymore, and you see him swimming under the sunset. It's such a touching moment, when you finally see the man Lt. Dan used to be.  Also, when Forrest sees his son for the first time, the shock and love on his face, and the grief he has on his face at Jenny's grave. Bottom line, I love this movie, and I give it 10 out of 10 stars."

He does everything with good heart and reaches success at the most important tasks of life.Only in America he could live such an interesting life: meet Elvis Presley, President Kennedy, John Lennon... He goes to Vietnam's war and he does everything following his heart. He becomes an American hero. Gary Sinise is a great American actor in his best performance too. He served in Vietnam with Forrest and was also a hero, protecting his men and fighting for his country.All in all this is a must-see movie for everyone, specially for non-Americans, so we can enjoy American culture and icons, as well as learn some American history, which is very useful."

Sign in to vote.,"A Heartwarming Rendition Of Love, Loss, Redemption & Stupidity.","Winner of 6 Academy Awards including Best Picture in the year that had heavyweights such as Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, Frank Darabont's The Shawshank Redemption & Disney's The Lion King, Forrest Gump isn't as impressive as the above-mentioned classics but its optimistic take on the unpredictability of life, stability between its genre elements, and a charismatic performance from Tom Hanks turns it into a cinema that's as heartwarming as it is amusing.Based on the novel of the same name, Forrest Gump tells the story of its titular character, a simple-minded, kind-hearted & good-natured guy from Alabama whose life turns out to be a wicked blend of luck & destiny as he steers through as well as influences some of the historic moments of the second half of 20th century America. However, despite accomplishing great things in life, what he covets most is the love of the woman he grew up with, who never reciprocates his feelings.Directed by Robert Zemeckis, Forrest Gump is a series of brief episodes stitched into one wonderfully layered tapestry and is expertly narrated from start to finish. There are a few hiccups in between but it is a smooth adventurous ride for the most part. Eric Roth's screenplay takes liberty with the source material but what's admirable about it is its relentless focus on the central character. It does allow its supporting characters to breathe but none of them have an arc that's compelling enough.Production design team does a stellar job in recreating the time-specific surroundings. Visual effects is extensively applied throughout the story plus its tinkering with the archival footages of some of United States' most significant events of the later half of the 20th century was a VFX feat of its time. There aren't any glaring issues with its camera-work. Editing fails to give it a tightly- knitted structure, while the background score & incorporated songs are in sync with the unfolding events & depicted timeline.Coming to the performances, Forrest Gump features a dependable cast in Tom Hanks, Robin Wright, Gary Sinise, Mykelti Williamson & Sally Field, and although everyone does well in their given roles, the film is powered by Hanks' outstanding performance. Fresh off his Oscar-winning role in Philadelphia, Hanks chips in with another smashing work and is the soul of this tale. And he's well supported by Sinise & Field who play Forrest's platoon leader & mother respectively while Wright ably portrays the self-destructive life of his love interest, Jenny.On an overall scale, Forrest Gump often gets a lot of flak for stripping both Pulp Fiction & The Shawshank Redemption off their deserving accolades but it does have a heart & identity of its own. I wasn't very impressed by it during my first viewing but it has managed to grow on me over the years and now I do admire its positive outlook on life & the numerous mysteries it has in store. A delightful comedy, an emotionally resonant drama & nicely covering the themes of love, loss, redemption & stupidity, Forrest Gump is one of the best films of its year. Definitely recommended."

I don't care what people say. either you loved this movie or hated it. I loved it. I thought it was the second best film of 1994, and in the top ten best films of the 90's. It's one of my favorite movies. Tom Hanks gave a great, if not his best performance in Forrest Gump (it's either this, 'Saving Private Ryan', or 'Big'). Robin Wright and Sally Field gave outstanding to Tam Hanks, but I thought that the performance to match with Tom Hanks' was Gary Sinise. This is his best performance (next to 'Of Mice and Men'). His character, Lieutenant Dan, is the most tragic as he goes from being a proud platoon leader in Vietnam to a faithless, surly man who is confined to a wheelchair, who blames Forrest for his legs. One of the most moving scenes is when he is on the shrimp boat with Forrest, thanks him for saving his life, and swims into the sunlight, where he makes his peace with God.Many people didn't like this movie because of the hype, or the lewdness (I've heard people complain of it before), or the story itself, but on any account, I loved this movie. It is very sad, funny, exciting, and heart warming. Robert Zemeckis did a great job with the direction. I think my favorite part was either the running scenes or the shrimp boat scenes. I think that any one could enjoy this movie, keeping in mind you know what your about to watch. 10/10"

Sign in to vote.,"Right Wing Propaganda Disguised as Heartwarming Family Film","FORREST GUMP may be the worst movie ever to win a Best Picture Oscar. It is one of the most manipulative, insulting, patronizing, hateful, repugnant pieces of celluloid garbage I have ever had the displeasure of watching ooze across the screen.The message of FORREST GUMP? Always do what you're told and never think for yourself and you'll get rich. But be individualistic and live an anti-establishment life and you'll get AIDS and die. That's this whole sickening movie in a nutshell. Let's be fair, though. The performances are what got this movie it's acclaim, and nothing else. Tom Hanks is superb, as are Gary Sinise, Mykelti Williamson and Sally Field. Robin Wright, as usual, appears to be reading from cue cards. The movie is well shot and there are some breathtaking moments, as when Forrest is running past the Rocky Mountains.On a technical note, I would love to castrate the SOB CGI artist who attempts to change people's lips to match new dialog written for them. And placing Hanks in newsreel footage over and over and over and over again. It's simply annoying, and serves no purpose other then to make us marvel at what they're capable of doing with special effects these days.According to this movie, Elvis couldn't come up with his own dance moves and John Lennon couldn't write "Imagine" without a little help from this brain dead moron. The only semi-positive aspect I can take from the movie's running joke of Gump creating many of our pop culture staples is that anyone who is amused by them must be as stupid as he is. There's a nice (and probably unintentional) satirical touch.FORREST GUMP is a right wing conservative propaganda film disguised as a heartwarming family film. It glorifies corporate greed, trivializes both Vietnam and the peace movement, and demonizes and lampoons anyone who tries to shake up the system. I despise this movie. What happened to Robert Zemeckis? This is the guy who gave us USED CARS, ROMANCING THE STONE, BACK TO THE FUTURE and WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT.I liked you a lot more before you sold your soul, Bob."

While it isn't a "Christmas Movie", to me it contains a message that is better than most Christmas movies. I have seen it a number of times over the years, I own the DVD. Sometimes I hesitate, because it is so long, but once I am watching it the time passes quickly, there is never a dull moment.To me the story here embodies the main messages that any of us should carry through life. Don't dwell on your shortcomings, look towards your opportunities. Play on your strengths. Be diligent, treat others well, be willing to learn from others, always give it your best. And it does all this in an entertaining way, through the fictional escapades of Gump.This is told in a fantasy story, of a young boy with leg braces and an I.Q. of 75, whose mother refused to let that get Forrest down. She always encouraged him. He never sought fame, but by sheer luck found himself in situations where his latent talents could come forward and shine. Tom Hanks of course is super as grown-up Forrest, and I believe this movie is well on its way to becoming a classic the way "A Wonderful Life" has become a classic."

Forrest reminds me a little bit of the childlike innocence set against the backdrop of the turmoil and cynicism that permeated the country during the latter half of the 20th century.  He was a simple man that was thrown into extraordinary circumstances and faced them with an innocence that many people no longer have.  However, while Forrest represented the innocence of that era, Jenny represented the harsh reality.  Jenny's character was pretty much shaped by the sexual, physical and mental abuse she suffered as a child.  We see her move from relationship to relationship and become involved in drugs, all the time growing up a very lonely person. All this comes to a head as she contracts the black plague of the last 20 years, AIDS.  This film is a very touching document of the second half of the 20th century and rightly deserves to be praised not just for the technical achievements, but for the wonderful and heartwarming story it is."

The work is so stunning in character, depth of story, direction, camera, editing, acting, and whatever else that makes a movie, that there is hardly anything to say, except see it if you haven't, and see it again if you have.Having lived through much of the period so incredibly depicted in the work, and having had many similar experiences,(a bit less dramatic, but emotionally equal), the work is as real as memory. The emotional power created in the work is overwhelming and wonderful. The Gump character, as vehicle through those incredible years, is cinematic genius, hilarious, ridiculous, endearing, hideous and heartbreaking, in a perfect body of work. Just see the flik, and please believe in it's accuracy as historic work, parody, irony, and any other five cent words that describe poetic perfection in a movie. It is as true as it gets on any level. Apocalypse Now may be the most accurate depiction of the psychology of war victims(I.e.combatants) ever produced, and Gump is equally perfect describing the psychology of the rest of us, mirrored against the character Gump, unchanged, unaffected, pure, but intensely human, perhaps perfectly human. Our reaction to this film is a great way to measure ourselves as human beings. What more can you say about a flik?"

2,25-Jun-00,tfrizzell,3,7,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"Tom Hanks and Amazing Special Effects",""Forrest Gump" dominated 1994.  The film was a box office smash and won six Academy Awards.  Tom Hanks (in his second Oscar winning performance consecutively) plays a simple man with an IQ of 75 who is somehow involved with every major American event from the mid-1950s to the early-1980s. Through his journey we meet his mother (Sally Field), his one true love Jenny (Robin Wright), his friend from the army Bubba (Mykelti Williamson), and his commanding officer Lieutenant Dan (Gary Sinise in an Oscar-nominated performance).  Gump is thrown into every significant event through amazing visual effects and editing techniques.  "Forrest Gump" is an outstanding achievement in the cinema from every point imaginable.  The cast is great and so are the mind-blowing visual effects which are still unbelievable six years later.  Robert Zemeckis, a Steven Spielberg disciple, became a household name with this film.  The screenplay is based on a book that was hardly read by anyone before this film came out in 1994.  It was the best film of 1994 and, with the exception of "Schindler's List", may be the best and most important film of the 1990s.  The fact that it won the Best Picture Oscar over "Pulp Fiction" and "The Shawshank Redemption" just adds to the greatness of this outstanding motion picture.  5 stars out of 5."

I thought it was a wonderful, magical tale about taking life slow and easy. But now I am older, and I see it as little more than an overlong showcase of clichés in which Tom Hanks talks in an embarrassing Southern drawl and plays a cardboard caricature.I admire Forrest for the good old boy that he is; unfortunately, that's ALL he is. If you will pardon the hyperbole, our mentally retarded hero is so pure and innocent and decent and good-hearted that he makes Jimmy Stewart's character in IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE look like a child pornographer. Whether he's the knight in shining armor protecting girlfriend Jenny from any menace; the selfless warrior rescuing all his comrades in the heat of battle; or the pious Christian whose faith remains fervent even as Lieutenant Dan Taylor curses God, Forrest Gump never does anything morally questionable.In addition, throughout the film Gump displays an "idiot savant" personality type that really gets on my nerves. Now I know that some autistic people are blessed with highly unusual skills, but it is simply not feasible that Forrest is perfect at everything he does. He runs faster, plays better ping-pong, assembles a rifle quicker, is more successful in the business world, and in general proves to be a whiz at almost everything through a combination of freakish talent and dumb luck.Not to be insensitive, but I think Gump had it pretty swell. After miraculously overcoming a childhood infirmity (really!) by busting the braces on his legs through sheer willpower, Forrest has an infinite string of good luck while all of his friends and loved ones either die painful deaths, surrender to their personal demons, or become human vegetables. These are the characters we should feel sorry for, and not Forrest Gump.If Gump had been plagued with at least ONE character flaw - alcoholism, for instance, or some kind of sexual disorder - then maybe I would find it easier to sympathize with him and rejoice in his many accomplishments. As it is, however, Hanks's character is hopelessly squeaky-clean.Which is not to say that FORREST GUMP is an inherently bad movie. It's fine, I suppose, if you like simpleminded morality plays. For the more cynical among us, however, GUMP is just too gummy."

The greatest.","There is an unfortunate time when you watch this film, its not the film thats the problem its my highly evident fear of the next few films I watch just seeming so bad. For simply not being this. Its everything. Its a romantic-comedy-tragedy-life-story-historical-personal- uplifting-war story. Every time I watch it I go on an emotional journey with the characters that are quickly built up in the world around Forrest. There is not much more I can say about this film that will say how much i like it, apart from award it the accolade that is; My favourite film. Over time the film stands up, the performances seem to get better knowing how Hanks has gone on to be a great actor. His supporting cast do a great job of making the world of the film feel believable."

I've seen it at least half a dozen times, and every time i cannot help but be touched.i think a lot of people are taking it far too seriously.i don't think this film is about all the events featured in it, its not about the moral implications of war, about the right and wrong way to live life, i don't even think its all that much about the "american dream" this film is about the way a simple minded innocent man LIVES through these experiences, its about his VIEWS on life.i think its really sad that people can watch this film and completely miss what makes it so moving. if u watch this film as a walk-through of the life of an extremely likable character, if u see it as he sees things, you will undoubtedly enjoy this movie experience. if your going to watch it to pick faults in the personality and views presented then you will undoubtedly find a lot to complain about.its a story about how one individual handles the situations that life throws at him. it is what makes this film so charming."

Sign in to vote.,"Dumb and dumbest","In the early 90s Michael Medved wrote a book urging Hollywood to eschew sex and violence and make films that extolled the virtues of America, family, religion, apple pie, Thanksgiving, home-baked cookies blah blah blah. He was arguing from a 'moral' (read 'conventional Western family-oriented' standpoint) but his argument also had a bearing on the bottom line. He reckoned that more 'nice' films would encourage more people back into the cinemas.Forrest Gump would appear to be the realisation of Medved's dream, to the extent that the movie also praises the virtue he left off the list, namely abject stupidity. Because that's what MM and his cronies really want, isn't it? Movies that don't challenge, don't irritate, don't ask awkward questions. Movies with no toilets (see Pleasantville), movies that operate on the assumption that a fortune-cookie-spouting dullard who loves his mom is some kind of embodiment of the American dream.Wake up, America. You managed to elect one Hollywood simpleton with a tenuous acquaintance to reality. Now you make movies about them. In the words of the greatest American philosopher, D'OH!This is a dumb movie, made by clever, cynical people, for other people who want to feel all warm and fuzzy and not worry about the fact that they lost all form of intellectual discrimination the day they took out that subscription to Reader's Digest. It sucks like an industrial vacuum cleaner on amphetamine sulphate. Yuk."

First he had his legs wrapped in iron and later he ran through the hole United States, just because he wanted to run, just carefree. This person has to be kind of naive or not? From the little kid that got mobbed to a national personality- that's the story of Forrest, Forrest Gump. Forrest Gump was actually the first movie that made me cry at the end. One now might think that it is a really sad story but there's also a lot of happiness in there. All that great things that naive Forrest experiences made me laugh.Although it is a quite long movie I could watch it again and again just because it's also very funny sometimes, it's the mix, I think between sadness and happiness that makes this movie one of the greatest ever."

First of all, Tom Hanks performance deserves praise.  His performance was dead on and wonderful.  The supporting actors deserve praise as well ( especially Gary Sinise).  The film editing was great as well.The movie itself did not move me like the Shawshank Redemption did ( both released in 1994).  The writing in Shawshank was much better ( one award of the six Gump won).The story of a simpleton floating through life doesn't appeal to me. There seemed to be no forward drive, and Robert Zemeckis seemed to want to create a surreal world ( where people are hurt, but not too badly) and ground it solidly in realism, which just doesn't work.I thought it deserved Best Actor, Supporting Actor, and Film Editing. The other three should have gone to other films"

2,11-Aug-03,Angry_Arguer,2,5,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"Shining over the darkness","Forrest Gump is touching to the melodramatic and sensitive.  Problem is, Robert Zemeckis is more concerned about glossing over the moments that viewers would find objectionable in order to make it more of a "happy-family-safe-crowd-pleasing-money-maker".  With Back to the Future and Death Becomes Her he wasn't as concerned about that, hence they were better movies.Such moments as drug addiction, exploitation, PTSD, the horrors of Vietnam, and the tirade of political violence that flows through the movie are done more for laughs or extracting faux-sentimental emotion from the audience rather than any actual history lesson in the works.  I can only imagine how Terry Gilliam or Oliver Stone of all people would have handled this.On the technical level, Forrest Gump is a trip.  As Zemeckis said, "It's not trying to wow you" and it doesn't.  CGI is used here the way it was supposed to, as a supporting element that enhances the experience.  The editing is also pretty good, many scenes flow into each other effectively and create interesting parallels.  Zemeckis also is finally concerned about what he puts on the screen, thus the cinematography is far better than anything else he previously did.  Hanks' performance is certainly inferior compared to Philadelphia or Saving Private Ryan.  What was the Academy thinking?While some may wax nostalgia about the passage of time from the 50s to the early 90s in American history, I will try to be supportive of the fact that the film keeps moving.  Unfortunately, the message (and hence the purpose) of the movie is constantly hammered at the audience in a fashion that celebrates foolishness.  How uninventive from a Hollywood "whiz kid".Overall, halfway decent, albeit sugarcoated, film.  If you want real history, watch Schindler's List instead.  3 out of 5 stars."

However, my comments concern one (possibly two) odd aspects of the moviePresident Jimmy Carter was NOT featured in the film. All the others except Ford (his omission is perhaps understandable) were featured. In fact, it turns out Forrest's actions were pivotal in the downfall of Nixon.There's another odd aspect about Jimmy Carter. Not long after Forrest is depicted watching American bi-centennial celebrations (July 4 1976, presumably) he starts running from sea to shining sea 'for no particular reason'. Furthermore, he stops running just prior to the depiction of the assassination attempt on Reagan, from memory. This means that Forrest was running (remember, 'for no particular reason') for just about exactly the duration of the Carter administration. I guess this explains why Forrest never met President Carter. Is this some sort of comment on the Carter administration (perhaps that America lost it's way under Carter - a dubious proposition at best) or simply co-incidence? I wonder!Also, the landscape at the spot where Forrest stops running is the same landscape featured on the Eagles Greatest Hits album. I don't think there's any sub text here, except that it's quite a remarkable landscape"

He tells his life story to anyone who wants to hear it. And what a story it is. Although simple-minded, following the advice of his mother and childhood friend Jenny, Forrest gets places. His mother tells him he's the same as everyone else, and no different at all. And she makes sure he goes to a regular school, no matter what it takes. And on the school bus he meets his one and only girlfriend, Jenny. Together they're like peas and carrots. She tells him that whenever he's in trouble, he should run away. And she cheers him shouting 'Run, Forrest, run!'. He can run like the wind blows. It literally takes him anywhere. During his travels, he also meets up with various interesting people and gets involved in American history in the making. Tom Hanks puts up a great performance and definitely pulls it off with flying colors. Robert Zemeckis, is a master of special effects, and uses it very effectively to include Forrest Gump into historical events. In the end, it's a wonderful and inspiring movie. Highly recommended.

I loved how the movie showed many historical events, just to name a couple: the Vietnam War and the Reagan assassination attempt. Some of the lines were pretty funny and even heartfelt.Another thing I love about this movie is how some of the characters talk about if we all have our own destiny or if we're just floating in a breeze. Something like that always gets me thinking about the life God has given me. Overall, Forrest Gump is an amazing movie that anybody will enjoy and that everyone should see.

Sign in to vote.,"A well written, well acted, and well directed masterpiece with a great message","Rating: 9.5 /10Teenagers often wonder which roads will bring them to success in life. Should I do what I am told to do? Or should I do what I want to do? Forrest Gump has the answer. Forrest Gump won Oscars awards for Best Picture, Best Actor(Tom Hanks), Best director(Robert Zemeckis), Film Editing, Visual Effects and Adapted Screenplay, winning over its competition, Pulp Fiction, in every category. What makes this masterpiece so successful?Forrest Gump has it all: entertainment, comedy, and drama. It is both serious and funny, entertaining but thought provoking, powerful yet charming, and it could make you laugh and cry with equal degree of ease. Forrest Gump touches every human's emotions and inspires everyone in different ways. Robert Zemeckis, known as the undisputed master of film technology, puts Winston Groom's novel to screen. He creates a masterpiece that combines the beauty of special effects and storytelling together. Adapted by Oscar-winning screenwriter Eric Roth, This film follows the journey of a not-so-smart man Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) through 30 years of trails and tribulation, placing Forrest within historical moments of history. How does he do it? He simply does whatever he is told and goes wherever the wind blows him. As Forrest would say "Life is like a box of chocolate, you never know what you are gonna get" However, The audience can hardly say that Forrest Gump is just an idiot who does whatever he is told to do. In fact, in his innocence, he does what he feels he has to do, no matter the situations and people around him, guided only by his inner sense of right and wrong. Throughout the journey of Forrest Gump, he meets different interesting people who are each valued very highly by Forrest. His mom, played by Sally Field, fought for his son in every way possible despite the fact that he is gifted with an IQ of just 75 and Jenny (Robin Wright), the love of Forrest's life, whom he met at school. There is also Bubba (Mykelti Williamson), Forrest's Vietnam War friend who dreams of owning a shrimp boat one day, and Lt. Dan (Gary Sinise) Forrest's lieutenant during his military service.Robert Zemeckis uses the techniques of characterization and symbolization to express the message of Forrest Gump. The main characters in this film represent different types of people in our society. They are all different in terms of how they live their lives and travel towards their destinies. Forrest is the feather, floating in the air, with no direct route or known destination whatsoever. Jenny is more like the birds; she chooses her path with more awareness. While Lt. Dan is represented by legs, shoes, and roads; he knows what he is destined to do in life.Robert Zemeckis, the director of the Back To The Future trilogy, once again accomplishes what he knows best: Special effects. The film covers a brief history of America for over a period of 30 years. Bringing this film credibility is the ability to place Forrest in history making events. These events range from Forrest teaching Elvis how to swing his hips to meeting Presidents for various accomplishments. These television clips are terrifically and creatively done in black and white by Zemeckis considering this is a 1996 film when Special effects haven't developed as much as they are today. The camera work in this film is very beautifully done balancing a variety of camera techniques. For most of the film, the movie seems slow paced by the way camera work is done. The camera is kept very still but somewhat poetic and moves slowly as the film carries on. It symbolizes the calmness of Forrest's life that is always changing and moving along until he reaches his destiny. However, when the film calls for action, the camera shots do not disappoint. The shaky camera and close-ups showing the characters' emotions work well during action sequences. At one point in Forrest's life where he travels to many different places, Zemickis uses establishing shots to show all the different settings that take place in this film.The actors' success in portraying their characters is a major factor in the film's awards. The on-screen chemistry between Tom Hanks and Robin Wright was phenomenal. Tom Hanks brings Forrest Gump into life and gives one of the best performances in his career. Gary Sinise is convincing as a man who is cheated by his own destiny. Eric Roth deservingly won Oscar for the beautiful screenplay he wrote which belongs in the company of sweet classics such as Rain man and Harvey. Forrest Gump could also be appreciated as a classic version of The curious case of Benjamin Button which has similar theme and message. Certainly, Forrest Gump deserves its place with all the classics in Film History. The message of Forrest Gump is a life-changing advice for teenagers who are struggling with their lives out in the real world. Forrest Gump offers them a simple but straight-to-the-point advice. It doesn't matter who we are or what we do; whether we are stupid or smart, rich or poor, black or white. Forrest teaches us to do everything with the best of our abilities. Forrest is an ordinary guy like we all are. He is teased and bullied about his stupidity from those around him. But he, with a heart of gold and a low IQ, never gives up. He goes out there, lives his life, and puts effort in everything he does. If only we all do everything with effort, we will one day reach our destinies like Forrest did."

In this 1994 film his portrayal of Forrest recaptures the sprit of his classic performance in Big (1988). The rest of the cast is also top notch with Sally Field and Gary Sinse turning in performances that deserved Oscars. Mention must be made of the two actors who portray Young Forrest and Young Jenny who also put in a good performance (although Hanna R.

I feel much same way about Bobby Z's FORREST GUMP.  A pure star vehicle for Tommy Gun Hanks.  He basically plays Jesus Christ without the ability to be a pacifist all of the time; which, I will admit, at times is touching.  Especially when he watches Jenny (Robin Wright Sean Penn) play guitar at a strip joint, mistaking the event for a legitimate concert, and then slugging the skum balls that harass her. I also praise this picture for not being preachy.  It deals with large chunks of American history and treats them objectively, letting us decide what really was going on during such turbulent times.  Gary Sinise is also a charm.  Unfortunately, huge parts of FORREST GUMP lack the firepower to keep us glued to the story.  As a result, we become bored and wonder when Bobby Z is ever going to have the guts to make a period peace that does not use the most cliched songs of all time. Ted's Grade: B-/B"

It is called treppenwitz.  I don't know if the filmmakers were aware of this word, but they sure knew how to use the spirit of it.  Treppenwitz pervades the many vicissitudes of the title character as his naiveté impels him not only through his own life, but also through many critical moments in history.  But, where many quirky takes on history dissolve into a one-joke show, `Forrest Gump' endears us, because of the touching nature of its simple protagonist.  As the story slips in and out of historical tableaus we focus not on the famous persons, but on Forrest, because only one as credulous as he could examine these happening impartially.Forrest could have been annoying, with his inane likeability and sententiousness.  But we realize that while we condescend to the verities that Forrest espouses, he is uncynical enough to find the implicit truth within them.  His simple nature is easy to admire, and perhaps even envy. Though only anecdotal, I have noticed that people who are concerned with the simpler aspects of life seem generally happier than others.  His credulousness serves as a sort of aloofness over many of life's drearier aspects.The bottom line is that I simply like films like this; low-key epics with the right mix of comedy, drama, and bits of history thrown in.  I'm not a big special effects buff, but here they are relevant in putting Forrest in the past, so I appreciate the work, and once more sing the praises of the magic of Hollywood."

My friends who liked the movie say I missed the entire point. I don't think so. It starts with some shocking vulgar scenes of Forrest's youth such as his mother sleeping with the school's principal in order for her son to be accepted at a `normal school' and other kids bullying him around because he can't walk -or act- normally. Throughout the movie we see Forrest succeeding at everything he tries, not because he really tries, but because things seem to fall from the sky right in his hands. Example: he becomes wealthy after investing in an `apple company' which was in fact Apple computers. Oh, oh the irony. Plus to most viewers annoyance (yes even the ones who think the movie is a classic) he keeps faithful to his girlfriend Jenny, a personification of the decadence of 60's America, even after she dumps him badly a couple of times.He have taught Elvis to dance, he was a hero in Nam, he met President Kennedy, John Lennon, he unveiled the Watergate Scandal, he played ping-pong in communist China.question is.what didn't he do?

Robert Zemeckis has the power to exhaust me, whether it's my emotions ("Contact", this film), my visual cortex ("Who Framed Roger Rabbit", "Contact"), or my funny bone ("Used Cars").  His screenplay is responsible for anything positive that came out of Steven Spielberg's 1979 flop "1941", (except for that astonishing dance sequence).  Here he tops his past films and screenplays and has not done quite as good since then.I'll be honest:  sentimentality has its proper place and time, and must be done right.  This film has it.  I laughed and cried, and was struck dumb with awe.Its six Oscars meant that a few better films, performers, and technicians were robbed blind, but let's be real, folks:  they're Academy Awards.  It's a popularity contest, and as long as we see it for what it is, we can just sit back and enjoy them.  "Forrest Gump" wouldn't get any prizes from me, for the simple reason that any category would be won by another film.  But an Oscar?  Sure, what the heck."

But this one was different because it really hit me deep at the very first viewing. And I cried every single time I saw it, which is very unusual of me. I also had a laugh and wondered at the images and the food for thought that is scattered through it. Some people say its message is very conservative, but I believe it manages to be a different movie to every viewer. It is more like a mirror: the way you see it is the way you see yourself. Maybe all films are like that in a way, but this here is a true fable about beliefs. Beyond the tears and laughter, you get to see how chance helps a lot, but mostly it is the way he sees the world that gets the guy the world he gets to live in. I do believe this movie says we should try to be true to our sense of what's good, and that's about all we can do in this crazy wonderful world. I'm just grateful for this film, for it did me good."

People in the movie made fun of him for being "stupid" yet we as a society seem to reward/idolize people who are cunning who often do bad things. When Forrest had to go back into a jungle that was being blown up, he didn't even think about whether it was a good thing to do for his own safety, he just did it. He always stuck up for Jenny when someone was hurting her in any way; again he didn't hesitate, he just did what he felt in his heart was the right thing to do.The other thing is, all the historical parts of this movie. So many pieces of American History were visited! That alone was worth watching. Working Elvis into it was really funny, as was the part where he gets shot.I also loved the music, almost every song in the movie was perfectly-fit for the scene it was in.The acting, obviously, was superb... Gary Sinese was a breakout role IMHO. Loved him in this.What an amazing, epic movie. IMHO, this was 100x better than the Godfather, or Gone with the Wind, which often gets rated much higher. Forrest Gump was simple and pure, a timeless movie no person should go without watching.-Tracy Milburn"

Sign in to vote.,"The South's greatest hero since Huck Finn","Some moral high grounders were up in arms over this film because of the depictions of sex, violence, drugs etc in it. Yes, the sleazy side of life features heavily in Forrest Gump but the film laughs at it. The film does not make out that there's anything admirable about sexual perversion, violence, heavy drinking or drug taking. Forrest always knows the right things to say and do and although he might not be too bright he is a better person than many of the people he encounters. He shuns the sleazy side of life (although in some ways he doesn't fully understand it) and this is symbolised in the scene when he pushes the hooker away when she tries to make love to him. Jenny poses for Playboy, plays the guitar naked in a perverts' club, takes drugs but Forrest is there for her as her gallant protector and moral guardian. Forrest is also only violent under extreme provocation such as in the scene with Wesley. Wesley sees Forrest in his army uniform and calls him a baby-killer but like many holier-than-thou pacifists Wesley is at heart a violent person who hits Jenny. Forrest duly lays into him and if this scene is violent it's no worse than the handsome hero in an old silent film giving the villain a good thrashing for what he's done to the heroine. Forrest is pleasant to everyone, be they people on the street or US Presidents. He speaks sadly about President Kennedy and John Lennon being shot. Also, he is awarded the Congressional Medal of Honour not for killing or destroying the enemy in Vietnam but for saving the lives of other soldiers at great personal risk to himself. He is a decent guy who is successful in life and the film is not patronising to handicapped people as some people have said. The portrayal of the single parent family has also been criticised but frankly the message here is "always be nice to your Momma". It is a feel good movie and although life from the 60s to the 80s may not always have been great this film show it in a positive light. Some scenes remind you of Midnight Cowboy and I think this is intentional. However Midnight Cowboy was a downbeat movie made at the end of the cynical 60s. This is a pleasant upbeat film. It is incidentally very different from Winston Groom's book and I think it is better than the book. The only thing I would have changed about the film  is that I wouldn't have had Jenny die at the end. To conclude, funny, heartwarming, original and brilliant."

The film is in fact just an excuse to absolve the entire baby boomer generation.  I also think that the film teaches us to never defy authority.  Think about Forrest never questions and he succeeds as a result.  The film is at best an over glorified retard film.  It is merely a decent film that attempts greatness. Its enormous popularity is another example of the people being doped into a waste of time.  The film is a technical masterpiece and I think it deserves some credit.  I can appreciate the packaging but not what is inside."

Sign in to vote.,"The problem with trying to fit a movie into a type-slot","I know many people who have gone to see movies and fail to grasp what is certainly the underlying subtleties the writers, producers and actors are trying to convey. I read the derisive comments on this movie and realize the impossibility of helping these people see what they are blind to. They look at 'Forrest Gump' and think "a movie about a guy who was not too bright and stumbled through life with great luck", they watch 'A Field of Dreams' and think it is a movie about baseball..... <<SIGH>> Some of us just have to be smacked in the head with it I guess. And please, don't think I subscribe to the new-age physco-babble sensitivity training induced brain-damaged politically-corrected point of view. Gump, and movies such as it, are not meant to be pulled apart scene-by-scene. They are works in full and as such can only be truly understood when viewed as that. Works that try to show lifes experiences and the journey that is life are often hard to tolerate, much less understand if we become so hardened and cynical the we see only the entertainment value in them. It is like going to the La Boheme and seeing only a sad story about poor people, or going to see a Ballet and remembering only that you saw some people dancing about. I you get it, nobody need explain it to you, if you do not get it, no amount of explanation will ever make it clear."

Sign in to vote.,"Beautifully imperfect commentary on America","Hailed as a classic when it first came out, "Forrest Gump" now appears to be looked upon as a travesty, a shallow celebration of America's innocence. Yet this retrospective view is somewhat missing the point.  For while the character of Forrest Gump is portrayed as being genuinely innocent, the American "innocence" he represents is not, nor is it ever intended to be.In this, the film works well both as life story and as unique commentary on the last 30 years of American history.  As played by Micheal Connor Humphreys and then Tom Hanks, Forrest Gump is a slow-witted but good hearted young man raised in Greenbow, Alabama by his feisty housekeeping mother(Sally Field).  Forrest's good intentions, his ability to run at great speeds, as well as his love for his abused and misguided best friend Jenny (who grows up to be Robin Wright) drive and define his life.  Forrest goes to college, enlists for the US Army and survives a posting to Vietnam and his various encounters with prominent historical figures, including JFK. Forrest recounts all of this to others whilst sitting on park bench awaiting a bus.This is far from a perfect film.  The many numerous spottable gaffes and mistakes put the Academy to shame for naming it Best Film of 1994.  The digital effects have dated, as has the tinkering of the various real video footage.  Yet this is largely superficial when considering the film's graces.The film's direction and use of music for scenes are very good in places, particularly for the scenes in Washington D.C with Forrest's triumphant reunion with Jenny after returning from Vietnam.Yet the film's defining point has to be it's acting.  Sally Field and Robin Wright give solid support; Field always the supportive and caring mother (who isn't above boffing the headmaster to get Forrest entry into a 'normal' school) and Wright as his loving, but self-destructive soulmate.  Gary Sinise also turns in a fine performance as Leiutenant Dan, who is crippled in Vietnam but whom, with Forrest's help, finds redemption and regains a sense of self.But this is Tom Hank's film.  However gushed his Oscar acceptance may have been, he did deserve the award for a performance that is alot more complex than first appears.  On the surface and to the core, Forrest is naive but essentially good individual.  Yet his park bench recollections continually undermine the idea of American innocence, rather than celebrating it.Forrest wistfully recalls his absent father being a member of the Klu Klux Clan.  Anyone with even a smattering of knowledge of American history will know the Clan were a gang of vicious white supremacists, rather than "people who dressed up ghosts, or spooks or something".  Forrest continually comments on the history he encounters in a very simplistic way that invites to both laugh at Forrest, as well as with him.This irony is repeated throughout the movie, even in throwaway moments. One such moment is Forrest and Leiutenant Dan's encounter with two whores in a bar just as New Year dawns on 1972.  One of the whores says with sadness in her voice "Don't you just love New Years?  You can start all over. Everybody gets a second chance..........."Hank's triumph is to combine the ironic aspects of Forrest Gump with the genuine warmth and sentimentality that is a part of the character.  With his much-quoted lines and awkward body language, he evokes sympathy from the audience.  His best moments in this come when he tells Jenny "I'm not a smart man.  But I know what love is", meeting his five year old son for the first time, and his final graveside speech to Jenny.Whilst "Pulp Fiction", released at the same time and contrasted with this film, may be a witty and irreverent take on the grimy realities of American life, it cannot compare with the grand combination of irony and warm sentiment in "Forrest Gump"."

2,15-Jan-03,glgioia,1,3,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,""Why don't you love me, Jenny?"","What will make this film endure is its apolitical skew when commenting on major political events. Everyone is parodied, everyone's hypocrisy revealed through Forest's simplicity, including the peaceniks - which is a welcome change to say the least. I truly believe this is one of the better films of the last quarter century. The reliance on special effects unfortunately will weaken this film over time, that's just inevitable. When you watch it now, the insertion of Forest into a number of historical events, which is a huge part of the film, already show an antiquated technology. While this was a new thing and sold the movie when it was released, it's more of a distraction now. There are roughly ten major scenarios or chapters in Forest's life that the film chronicles. Each completely as unrelated as can be imagined, but they are all done so well and woven together so finely, that never once is continuity threatened. The fifteen minutes or so of Viet Nam is as good as that gets. The photography goes heavy on the earth's natural beauty, and seeks to subliminally remind us how meaningless are all of the seemingly crucial events that pop off while we live our lives. Forest's inferior intellect allows him, although sadly unrealistically, to seek and win simple love, gain serendipitous fame and fortune, and ultimately attain nirvana because he is not burdened by intellectual fear or cerebral reasoning. Really makes you stop and think about what is important in this life we are blessed with."

Sign in to vote.,"Commerating the 10th Anniversary of an American classic","Wow,it has been ten years ago........By the time "Forrest Gump" swept most of the major 1994 Academy Awards,it had already become the third-highest grossing film of all time,as well as a genuine pop phenomenon embracing best selling books,gnomic catch phrases,and reams of commentary on the editorial pages of magazines and newspapers throughout the world. It has already broken box office records worldwide and stands behind great cinema classics like "Raiders Of The Lost Ark","E.T.","Titanic","The Lion King",and so many more. Even through its distribution of its market through DVD and video,it has grossed even more domestic wealth and still holds that mark as of today,even after its release more than ten years ago. Clearly,a great event,FORREST GUMP,is a great film and a great piece of cinematic magic within itself. It has the form of an epic that goes within the boundaries of depth and resonance;the trappings of satire without a coherent attitude,and the semblance of historical revisionism without a critical sensibility. To paraphrase the screenplay,FORREST GUMP,may not be a smart film,but it knows what love is-its dim-witted protagonist,as expertly portrayed by Tom Hanks,has captured the love of millions,which by the way made Tom Hanks,the Jimmy Stewart of our generation. Despite its limitations,FORREST GUMP has charm to spare,thanks to an enduring central performance by Tom Hanks,as well as a series of irresistibly playful historical tableau's achieved with unprecedented verisimilitude by the computer-savvy artists at George Lucas' Industrial Light and Magic. Although fictional protagonists have been made to interact with historical figures in CITIZEN KANE and ZELIG,FORREST GUMP represents a technological breakthrough. Unfortunably it is also far less thoughtful than these illustrious processors,and at times seems nearly as simple minded as its protagonist. While FORREST GUMP stands out as a break taking cinematic masterpiece,it is a remarkably brilliant one through various scenes as it follows the character through three decades of turmoil which begins with his upbringing in rural Greenbow,Alabama through various events that featuring computerized images of Governor George Wallace,President Kennedy at the White House,and his meeting with President Johnson as Forrest receives the Medal Of Honor for bravery during his turmoil in Vietnam and that continues throughout as he joins a ping-pong team that takes a tour of China and his meeting with President Nixon,and accidentally uncovers the Watergate break-in of the 1970's. However,its vision of the Vietnam War,for example,is constructed not from historical memory,but by means of a deft deployment of clichés drawn from the most prominent movies that display the Vietnam War in general(examples from such films as Apocalypse Now,The Deer Hunter,Coming Home,Platoon,and Born On The Fourth Of July).Indeed,director Robert Zemeckis's period recreations depend more on the music of that period than any other visual sense of time and place:once the wall to wall soundtrack of the period kicks in which contains hits from various groups from the 1960's and early 1970's. The characters here are very well supportive with outstanding performances from actresses Sally Field,and Robin Wright-Penn to actor Gary Sinise's portrayal of Lt. Dan,who does a fair impression of Willem Dafoe from two Oliver Stone films;PLATOON(with legs)and BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY (without as a paraplegic)to a supportive acting from Mykelti Williamson as Forrest's best friend Bubba. Although Winston Groom's original novel contains some astringent satire,the film's version settles for gentle jabs at racism and the military. Unusually vague it is attitude towards the events and its depicts,FORREST GUMP went on the sweep the Oscars for Best Picture,Best Director(Robert Zemeckis),Best Actor(Tom Hanks), Best Adapted Screenplay(Eric Roth),and Best Supportive Actor(Gary Sinise),and still went on the become one of the biggest moneymaking films of 1994.Even after ten years,it is still embraced by several national figures as a celebration of traditional values and a condemnation of the 1960's counterculture. In many ways,the film still represents old-fashioned Hollywood liberalism where racists are wrong,war is hell,assassinations are bad,and it's good to be nice--even if the world is different from various places. Still,the films a lot of heart and a lot of guts and brains to make it possible. Congradulations on your 10th Anniversary-- FORREST GUMP."

Forest Gump by Robert Zemeckis can be movie about anything you want. It can be movie about American History at galnce, Vietnam or about not too bright guy named Forrest Gump who gets lucky. He survives in Vietnam, make a few millions, etc... although i was surprised that amongst nearly 100 comments i have read. I havent' seen anyone who would define a film storyline as a lovestory, not as american history at glance with offensive characters painted by stupid Forrest Gump and his black best friend, who is not so bright too and speak about his shrimp business all the time. A love story of two strong personalities, who live their life through their mistakes to surrender to what was set long time ago."

The movie is unique in that it evokes laughter and tears at the same time and you feel both swelling up inside you and you literally honestly really don't know which will win out and come out first.The trivia section for this movie is ripe with clues that some people don't seem to get - but without getting them it's a mystery what people see in the movie. That a song called Blowin' in the Wind was written by Bob Dylan but the performer in the movie uses the stage name Bobbie Dylan - would this scene have any value, make any sense, if we didn't know that? It's clear that to some nuggets like this were pure revelation.As a keeper it's weak. You start to see where the story line is 'just a bit too thin', but this is the second Oscar in a row for Hanks (after Philadelphia) and no offense to the easily offended Hoffman, but this one takes a lot more work and talent than tilting one's head to the side and insisting there are 246 toothpicks on the floor when you really don't have a clue.Was released twice in the same year and cleaned up both times; won six of its possible thirteen Oscars; Hans Zimmer is good and his music was no exception in The Lion King, but it's a shame one can't give awards to all who are deserving: Silvestri's work on this one is some of the best of the past ten years."

The nation laughed and cried along with Forrest throughout the course of the movie and through pure visceral emotion, resulted in Academy Awards out the wazoo.  If this movie evoked any kind of response out of me, I might say it made me cry... out of pure boredom.  I was disappointed in the ridiculousness of "Forrest Gump", a lot of the reason being because I hold Tom Hanks in such high regard and never once thought that he would be one to promote the patronizing American Dream theory.  It completely blows my mind that this movie received so many awards and so much hype when it is utterly unbelievable and absolutely unrealistic. The braces bursting from Forrest's legs, his unintentional football scholarship to college, his meeting the president (and might I add his only words to Mr. Kennedy were "I have to go pee"), his millions earned through ping-pong, his (how pathetic) running across America four times for "no reason at all", his "inventing" the happy face symbol by wiping his face on a towel... all this is just incredibly... stupid, if I may be so blunt.  The movie attempts to show that to succeed in life, one does not need to be overly intelligent, all one needs is a lot of heart.  Very touching, but dense all the same and the movie is so far out that viewers only see it as entertainment and will not derive motivation to make something of themselves.  Tom Hanks does a wonderful job and is convincing as a mentally-challenged man, but the movie as a whole, the supposed "story-line" and non-existent plot are pathetic and hold no ground.  "Forrest Gump" deserved no awards in my opinion."

They are probably the same crowd who thought American Beauty sucked, so, obviously, they wouldn't know a good movie if it kicked them in their dumb-asses.

The character of Forrest Gump is so well thought of. It is a symbol for hope. The performance done by Tom Hanks is one of the best I have seen. First off, it gets a lot of hate around here, but the truth is, only a great actor could pull it off.Tom Hanks did amazing as the mentally challenged man. The way the film starts off, it is sort of a 'fairy tale'. Yes, it seems a bit theatrical at times, but this is the whole tone of the film. the film is trying to teach us more. the film is trying to pull the audience in an emotional way, and let me tell you, it does. We can really feel for every single character. The mom tries to do what every other mom tries to do these days. She is trying to raise her child the best way possible, in all means trying to keep him away from the cruelty of the world. This film represents life in a sort of light and innocent way, mainly because it is told from Forrest's point of view. The other characters, Forrest's friends that interwine in his life, Bubba and Lt. Dave, are all very well-rounded. They represent other symbols. The performance given by Gary Sinise is perfect. he perfectly captures his character's struggles. He is a very confused and 'bad' character in a way, but the way Forrest changes him and gives him hope is truly inspiring. The other character who I also think is sort of dark in a way, is Jenny. Jenny represents a lot of people these days. No, she is not 'evil', but like a lot of people these days, she is lost and doesn't know who she really is or what she really wants to do. her journey throughout the film is also very developed, and the actress playing her, Robin Writh Penn did a great job. Sally Field, of course, is great and wimsy and perfect in her performance.What is amazing in this film is not only the unforgettable characters and the amazing screenplay, but also the amazing cinematography and sets. The setting designs are so well put together, yes, they look very realistic, they are. It fits well with the tone of the film. The direction is also amazing. It really gives us thought to the characters, as does the pace of the wonderful film editing. The music scores used are simply fantastic, as they also represent the whole feeling of the film.At the end of the film, I found myself overly emotional at all the scenes. Not only because of the well put ending, but because I just remembered the whole journey Forrest Gump had. You simply cannot be in anything but simple 'awe' over the film. You realize how much you care about all these situations and characters. At the end of the day, this film is what every film should be. Give us a little bit of unfamiliar realistic life lessons, give us the truth in a not so disturbing way, but also simply gives us hope and uplift the audience(Forrest Gump's run across American is one of the best single moments in cinema history). This film is simple perfect, and it really surprised me. Perfect film-making."

2,14-Jun-04,kingtanichi,1,3,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"Not bad, but definitely no masterpiece","This movie is a great example of right-wing sophistry. It asks us to believe that it's best to just unthinkingly act according to our own moral inclinations (assuming, of course, that they are the product of simple and well-off Christian upbringing), and put blind faith in the existing order, which will of course self-correct if it ever errs. It glorifies the vast accumulation of wealth because you will of course share it around, and treats military service as an inevitability not to be questioned.Now in all fairness, this is an oversimplification of the film's message. If this had been all there was to the film, it would likely have been a box-office bomb and generated as much negative feedback as it ultimately did positive. But this is the core of the film. The best that can be said for it is that it delivers this conservative message with several liberal flourishes, making it politically intriguing.For example, the single mother who gets her unqualified son into school by having sex with the principal hardly squares with the kind of persona one would usually attribute to a 50s woman who is horrified by Elvis's pelvic antics. And it is to the film's credit that while it implies stupidity to be useful in all aspects of life, it explicitly states that it is your best friend in the military. The film does vilify a lot of the youth protest movements of the 60s, but it also seems to take a sardonic glee in Edgar Wallace being shot, and it plays for laughs Forrest Gump showing his ass to Lyndon Johnson. And note the photo of Marilyn Monroe in JFK's bathroom.On paper, this would sound like an explosive movie, but most people seem to take it as just a harmless and fun experience. No doubt this is because of the core element -- Tom Hanks's performance. And honestly, this is excellent. Hanks makes Forrest Gump likable and sincere in a way few, if any, other actors could have. My personal Tom Hanks heaven will always be G.H. Dorr, PhD, from The Ladykillers, but this is deservedly some of his best-known work."

His powerful, emotionally in-depth journey takes him through the bitter integration of public school systems, an unexpectedly glorious college football career, a tour of duty through Vietnam, and fame and fortune as an unlikely shrimp boat captain, all the while staying true to his uninformed but gripping will and determination. Takes its time to unfold, but the result is a well-crafted, insightful, and in-depth historical journey played to perfection by Hanks and his talented co-stars. Simply wonderful. ***½"

What makes this movie so great and enjoyable is that everything is so interesting. I've seen this movie a hundred times, and I never lose interest. The performances are so great. Tom Hanks gives the performance of his great career. He makes you think even when he just sits there and stares. Like when he is just sitting there on the porch thinking. Also Gary Sinise is superb as Dan Taylor. Mykelti Williamson is memerable as Gumps kind of lugish friend Bubba. And Sally Field is great like always.Although this film is through the eyes of a very simple man, it is about a big question. Do we all have a destiny in life or are we all just floating like a feather on a breeze? Gump tries to find this out but all he finds out the only things important in life is the love of true friends, and family. Nothing else matters. Not awards from presidents, being a football star, or being a shrimping tycoon. Only being in the arms of your true love.This movie is superb in every way. Every one in America should see this film."

Tom Hanks is good but his performance wasn't award worthy. The film takes a (MINOR SPOILERS) conservative view of American politics but it is deeper than its critics suggest. In fact, the film pokes fun at the average person who goes through life blissfully unaware of the importance of events happening around him/her. The Special Effects are effective and the period detail impeccable. There is an affecting moment earlier in the picture which brought tears to my eyes.

2,27-Feb-00,TMC-4,1,4,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"At Times Fascinating and Informative but Also Considerably Offensive","Perhaps the most interesting aspect in Forrest Gump is its various alternations of certain historical events.  While these scenes (presented in the fashion of archives) which center on interaction with numerous past famous people essentially appears to be contrived (not to mention that the film also could have gone further with the satire), this can also serve as some type of source for information on the United States and are amusing and inventive. The storytelling in general, feels like a way to provide some type of information and history of the United States at a certain period. But the film as a whole feels bloated, and along the way, some considerably offensive material can be found here and there.  At one point, there's a feeling that the script is trying to lay down a stereotype people based on the type of states that they live in.  The script in certain areas takes some humor and/or tries to create satire out of people with various physical disabilities along with seemingly attempting to create some humor out of a racial slur based on misinterpretation from the title character.  Certain points in the story are brought up in a relatively low key fashion but we still can help to come to a foregone conclusion on the meaning of the particular topics that are discussed.  Along with that, Forrest Gump occasionally aims for absolutely low brow humor rather than providing more necessary satire.  While the musical score makes for a good set piece, the drama to a certain extent can also rub you the wrong way.  It at times breaks down and treads into sappy territory and can also get pretty manipulative.  Take for instance a small reference to AIDS which by itself feels tagged onto the story."

Sign in to vote.,"The "Gone With the Wind" of the Baby-Boomer Generation","This movie has been on TV a lot lately, and just last night the excellent TCM channel showed it---I'm not sure if it was edited, because it was so engrossing and moving I would not have noticed an F-word or any other classless anomaly that sprung from the baby-boomer generation. "Forrest Gump" is a masterpiece, placing Robert Zemekis on the same deserved pedestal as Spielberg, Ford, Fleming or Minnelli.The emotional similarity between "Gump" and "GWTW" is evident by the end of the movie. In GWTW we watched as the Old South died and passed into legend....in Gump, we watch the beginning of the death of our entire nation as drug-addled baby-boomers and minorities who never knew a day of slavery in their lives began the slow destruction one of the truly greatest nations in the history of the planet. At the end of Gump, the America that some of its citizens today still insist exists, is actually dead...it's long march into chaos marked by a black wall with over 50,000 names engraved on it. Ironic to realize that the greatest of all American generations, the WWII generation mistakenly pursued the path of war in Vietnam. They thought they were doing the right thing.Tom Hanks and Gary Sinese were luminous in this film, and Robin Wright Penn was haunting as she mirrored almost every hippie girl encountered in the years from 1968 to 1978.....there is horror and humor and impossible coincidences as Zemekis' Everyman GI tries to get along in a post-American world. In the end it is the white feather of love and life that is blown into the blue skies of Alabama as Forrest watches his little boy get on the school bus.I realize I have now written of this movie, but I really sit and watch it speechless. When Forrest punches out the yippie freak who manhandles his beloved Jenny, and the lush jangle of Jim McGuinn's Rickenbacker 12-string announces the song "Turn, Turn, Turn", tears fill my eyes every time. One of the greatest match-ups of screen and music I've ever seen.Ecclesiastics, Pete Seeger and The Byrd's were right....to everything there is a season.... and in 1968, the season began to wane for the American Camelot. "Forrest Gump" should be preserved in a time capsule."

2,18-Apr-99,bwaynef,0,2,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"Tom Hanks makes it work","Some of its critics say that "Forrest Gump" is little more than a right wing fable whose message is "Vote Republican."  Yes, Forrest is the embodiment of "traditional values," a simpleton who worships God, honors his mother, does what he's told, and never asks questions.  Good old Forrest succeeds in life by embracing the values of mainstream society while  Jenny, the girl he loves with a blind passion, pursues the fancy-free lifestyles in vogue at each time period portrayed:  In the 1960s, she joins the counterculture, strumming a guitar, smoking dope, dropping acid, and protesting the war in Vietnam in which Forrest courageously fights.  In the 70s, while Forrest is a successful businessman, Jenny is a fast living, sexually promiscuous member of the disco set.Forrest represents America, or, rather, the America that right wing propagandists want everyone to believe is the true America.  Do what you're told, never talk back, and you'll be successful and happy.  Jenny, on the other hand, epitomizes rebellion and the rejection of the unthinking way of life that the government would prefer we pursue.  Forrest is good.  Jenny is bad.  Forrest further strengthens his image of goodness by always, always, ALWAYS taking Jenny back whenever her latest flirtations fail to fulfill her.  Like Jesus, Forrest loves Jenny unconditionally, never questioning her lack of faithfulness.  Yes, this film says, America forgives all of you long-haired, dope smoking, draft-dodging sex perverts, or we will if you agree to shape up, and fast.  For Jenny, however, it was too late.  Once she settled down into a respectable middle-class life, her past caught up with her.Of course, some people see the above interpretation  as hogwash.  They maintain that "Forrest Gump" is simply a fable promoting such tried and true values as honoring your parents and your God.  It's the story of innocence uncorrupted by a greedy, frequently hateful and dishonest world.  No matter how evil the times, goodness can prevail.I must say I can relate to the criticisms; they have validity. But so do the arguments of those who champion the film.  It is with the latter group that I side, and Tom Hanks, more than anything else, is the reason.  Not since James Stewart has an actor so believably portrayed kindness and decency. Hanks makes this film work, and his performance can even help you overlook the often awkward special-effects (the scene in which Forrest appears on "The Dick Cavett Show" with John Lennon failed to convince).  I think Morgan Freeman deserved the Oscar that year for "The Shawshank Redemption," but of all the people who took home Oscars for "Forrest Gump," no one earned theirs more than Hanks.  I can't imagine another actor (a living one, anyway) taking on this character and pulling it off as splendidly as he did."

Forrest might have a low IQ, but yet, he smarter than most people I know.  He knows it's not right for Jenny's boyfriend to hit her.  He's also very loyal.  Even though Lieutenant Dan gives Forrest a hard time, Forrest always stays his friend.  He also keeps his promise to Bubba, by starting the shrimp business.  Finally, he's always loyal to Jenny, the love of his life.  She changes with the times, but Forrest always waits for her.  Also, when Forrest goes to visit her grave, he leaves the note that young Forrest wrote to her.  He told his dad not to open it, so he didn't.  That too shows that Forrest keeps his promises.Just when I thought that Tom Hanks's performance in "Philadelphia" was his best, he comes out with Forrest Gump.  He is one of the best actors today, if not the best.  "Forrest Gump" is a movie you'll want to see again and again...it's a masterpiece!"

It was touching, often very funny, but somehow, Forrest went from the "loveable idiot" of Winston Groom's novel to a "leftover innocent" who goes with the flow.  Still, I think Tom Hanks did a good job as Forrest, as did the rest of the cast.  What I really liked, I think, were the references to the "greats" of the day like Elvis, JFK and such, but they don't really SAY who they are. And then there's everyone going around in a hurry as America goes from the idyllic pastel days of the fifties and into the disillusioned, paisley world of the sixties.  But through it all, Forrest has no idea what's going on. He does everything well, I think, like his drills (G*****n genius with an outstanding IQ) or a shrimp captain (pure luck + prayer), and father (don't know how he did that).  And mostly, he goes with his heart wherever his brain cannot (which is QUITE frequently).  And that, I think, was what the movie was trying to say."

Tom Hanks is one of the best actors that I have ever seen and his portrayal of the slightly dim but warm hearted Forrest Gump is just one of the many examples of this. The plot is very cleverly interwoven with very memorable historical events making us relate and love the character Gump even more. To say that this film is over-rated is to be blind to the pure genius that is the whole story. If it is such a bad film then why would it have been nominated for so many awards? Why did Tom Hanks win an oscar for it? Finally, why is it repeated on TV all the time with thousands upon millions of viewers tuning in to watch Forest's trials and tribulations, slowly but surely falling in love with his character and watching with disgust at Jenny as she fails to notice this sweet, kind and caring man infront of her and chooses the guys who will only let her down time and time again. When I see that film, I always cry, and call me sentimental if you want I can't help but relate to this poor boy who just wants the simple life without having all these people entwined with him, many presidents, Elvis, Chinese world ping-pong champions and the first ever black people to be allowed in white schools! Even through all this, anyone who has a heart can not fail to be touched by, even though this guy has everything that anyone could ever want, all he wants is Jenny."

Well he doesn't stay physically retarded for very long, quite the opposite. We get to see to see quite a few American icons (OK, John Lennon was English, but like some of the other notable people we see he got assassinated by a mad gunman.) The film manages to maintain a didactically neutral attitude towards the events and people it shows - the facts alone - but is heavy on sentimentality, which no doubt is good for box office takings. Inane it certainly is, but has excellent set design and cinematography, has good flow, and great songs on the soundtrack. Worth watching. 8/10"

Brilliant performances from Sinise, and especially Tom Hanks makes this movie even better, BUT... it did not deserve the best picture oscar. As good as it may be, it was not good enough. I would recommend this movie to everyone, but don't take the film too seriously - you might find it very stupid."

I was realy sorry for Forrest in very scenes because of the way that jenny was to him . I agree with the comment that says that she was using him all the long and it made me think that we all are used by someone at least one time in life. I have only one problem with this film and it regards to the oscars because this film beat 2 of my favorite films of all time (pulp fiction and Shawshank Redemption )."

My son is intellectually disabled and I hope his life will be a full as Forrest's (without going to war though....pass on that one!).The characters are all spot on. What young man hasn't been secretly in love with a "Jenny" who spurned his love when it wasn't convenient but needed it when the frivolous part of her life was over. The pop singer Prince once had a line in a song "Life is just a party and parties weren't meant to last!".From the passing of Forrest's mother to Bubba to Jenny Forrest outlived them all and was somehow a better person, a more complete human being for the experience.10/10 for a movie with heart.PS  The gunfire and napalm scenes in the jungle were brilliant!"

Sign in to vote.,"An ordinary man","I think that TV Guide (wasn't it?) summed the movie up very well, when they said this movie was about the adventures of an ordinary man. The film was kind of an homage to what can just plain happen to anyone. Who could ever be entertained (or forget for that matter) the wily accent Forrest Gump had in this movie? This was released in 1994. That was a very good movie year. This and "The Mask" (another favorite of mine) came out. They slowly showed how Gump was expriencing the important elements and occurings of the 20th century. I once went to a restaruant that was completely devoted to Forrest Gump. I think it was called "Bubba's Grill" or something like that, and they showed all the things featured in the movie. Like all those drink bottles that Forrest drank that caused him to say "I got to pee" to president Kennedy. You could never forget the various "words of wisdom" in that movie ("What's vacation?" "It's when you go to a place and you don't ever come back" "My mother always says, stupid is as stupid does") Another favorite part was the subplot with Lieut. Dan. With he lost his legs and years later, you see him a better man with metal legs. This was based on a book. A writing teacher of mine, Mrs. Olmar said FG was the only movie based on a book that was better than the book. She said in the book, Forrest went into space with a monkey and a woman(!). The floating feather effect was nice too. Tom Hanks is another favorite actor of mine, with his roles in movies like FG and "Toy Story". Anyway, I'll give it a 9/10. Really nice movie. Forrest Gump: (talking about president Kennedy) Then they shot him, and a few years later, they shot his brother."

Sign in to vote.,"A big meal that's easy to digest but nonetheless delicious","OK, unlike some of you, I am not going to slam this film out of anger just because it beat out "Pulp Fiction" and "The Shawshank Redemption" on the 1994 awards circuit.  Yes, this film was made with broad eyes and simple minds.  Yes, it partially served as a candy-coated time capsule for those narcissistic baby boomers.  Yes, as usual, the film is loaded with Zemekis' right-wing ideals clumsily disguised as cuddly Hallmark Card sentiments. One thing that may have bothered people is how American this film is.  It is SO American, so much so that I ask you to think of a recent film that is so American that isn't completely set in some military environment. Nonetheless, I loved the epic scope and reach of this film.  It restored my belief that people still want to make "magical" films.  The breadth of this film is as close to an old MGM musical as we're going to get these days.I don't think Tom Hanks was playing over-the-top (that endeavor belongs to Al Pacino), he hit the note just right with his mix of innocence and morality.  Gary Sinise got damn lucky with this film.  Like Richard Gere, Sinise suffers from the John Travolta syndrome; they're all good actors who have a habit of picking bad movies.  But Sinise must have known how juicy this role was, his poker-face reaction to the New Year's party is just incredible.  Robin Wright-Penn also gave a great performance, and you have to give credit where credit is due; The role of Jenny is one of a few female characters in film whose purpose of existence is not defined solely through the male lead (although her story is chronicled on a separate timeline than Forrest's).  The Bubba character was given a good dose of sympathy to prevent him from becoming a Southern country-boy caricature.  And his friendship with Forrest demonstrates an indifferent towards American racism that only a child is capable of (also remember, these two guys are from the South).  I was most impressed with the song medley they concocted for the running sequence.  The scene takes place in the late 70's, and they choose all these classic 70's songs that have themes of movement or travel ("Go Your Own Way," "Running On Empty," "On The Road Again," "Against The Wind"). It is all edited together quite wonderfully.  I'm not a huge Zemekis fan (I think his Spielbergian tendencies are a little obvious at times), but this is a beautiful film."

Sign in to vote.,"Forrest Gump","Forrest Gump is a 1994 American film based on a novel by Winston Groom ,the genre of film is comedy Drama and Robert Zemeckis is the director of film. The main actors are Tom Hanks ,Robin Wright and Gary Sinisie .the film was nominated for thirteen Oscars and swept six of them including ,best leading actor Tom Hanks, best director ,best film editing ,best picture, best visual effects and best adapted screenplay. The film in box office could take near $ 700, 000,000 worldwide. The film is production of Paramount pictures. Summary and plot A man with low IQ waiting in a bus station tells his life story to a women sitting near him. he recounts all events in his life , about his mother ,his military service ,being sent to Vietnam ,saving his commander 's life and coming back home like a hero ,he remembers visiting some presidents of the US ,and getting rich in shrimping industry. he finds his lost love , jenny but he is too stupid to understand the importance of his action in his life. Making films about retarded people is not a new case, at least we have three movies which theirs heroes are people with problem in IQ Forrest Gump, Rain Man and I am Sam .the common fact about three films starring success to taking awards. the director Robert Zemeckis made one on of the his best films in his career and tom Hanks played one of the most praised acting in the world. Forrest joins to the army randomly and without seeking to be hero becomes a national hero similarly when he plays ping pong he doesn't have any motives ,we can see this when he goes to university ,In Beijing ,china , Forrest saves Mao from drowning . Forrest Gump has several messages, some of which are less obvious than the others. The most frequently recurring theme is not to give up on life. Why surrender when you don't know what lies ahead? By contrasting Forrest's life with the lives of those around him, and by showing how the passage of time brings solace to even the most embittered hearts, the movie underlines this point. Tom hanks was the only actor who could play this role , after watching the film I can't imagine somebody other than Tom hanks could show this modesty ,outspoken simplicity as he did. The film is the mixture of tragedy and comedy and lots of significant truths are hidden in it. Forrest Gump has lots of memorable quotes for example "I am not a smart man ,but I know what love is " or " stupid is as stupid does " !"

2,10-Apr-00,smaurer1,1,2,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"A fairy tale, but then much more.","This movie is a fairy tale, and its review of US history is oversimplified at best. But because the movie does not claim realism, these things don't bother me the way they normally do. The movie is light and mostly funny while you watch it, but what sticks is much deeper. It is a modern version of a classic literary theme: the idiot who is thereby wiser than the rest of us.  Forrest is too dumb to hate blacks.  He is too dumb not to keep his promises and give away his money. He is too dumb not to save Lt. Dan, twice, once in battle and later, through continued good will and positive attitude, from himself.  He is too dumb to give up on his hopeless love. One is left inspired by this modern morality play, inspired to try to be a little better person, in hopes that in real life goodness might have just a bit of the effects it has in this movie.I watched this movie with my kids, ages 10 and 13. It was more explicit than I expected for a PG-13, and halfway through I wondered if I had made a mistake showing it to them. But no, it was a very good movie for them, for the reasons discussed above.  Also for another reason: their knowledge of the times of the movie was limited, and their questions from the movie led to several good discussions."

2,5-Mar-01,Luckie Starr,1,2,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"A brilliant, but misunderstood movie","I adore this movie. The casting was exceptional, especially Sally Field and Robin Wright Penn. The soundtrack fit perfectly. The only thing is, I don't believe many people actually understand what Forrest Gump is about. Many see it as a sentimental story among the backdrop of the late twentieth century, complete with events like the Vietnam War, the Civil Rights movement, the Disco Era, the AIDS scare, ect. Actually, this film is a spoof on reality. I came up with this theory the first time I watched it, and have since heard similar comments from the director, Robert Zemekis. It is absurd how a man from a small town in the deep south with an IQ of 75 can become so entangled in American history - becoming a war hero, meeting several presidents, playing ping-pong in China. It's really a comment on American life. In a way, Forrest Gump represents a skewed version of Everyman. That, along with everything I have already mentioned, makes this a brilliant and wonderful film. If you have never thought of this before, try watching the film with this theory in mind. I promise you'll see it in a different way."

Jenny tells him that it would have been nice to be with him during those times. Forrest tells her, "But you were, Jenny." Corny? Maybe.

That someone can be satisfied from the purity and simplicity of his life is truly amazing and should be a lesson to us all.It's also a story of the differences between people, and how despite those differences we can still connect. He shares his life story with strangers while waiting for the bus, and he affects all of those characters in different ways, just like this movie affected different viewers in different ways. Some of them disregard him as just the dumb guy waiting for the bus, but some of them listen to him, most notably the older woman at the end who doesn't get on the bus because she truly wants to hear his story.There are many other ways to perceive this story. You can see it as the story of a man who loves a woman struggling between goodness and immorality, or as an essay on how people change over time, or even how ignorance can breed contentment.But no matter what you see in this movie, you find that it's a multi-faceted study on life, and you see glimpses of yourself in the characters. It reaches humans on every level - it makes us laugh, cry, contemplate... and our hearts soar whenever something good happens.Hopefully you too will watch this movie and get one step closer to figuring out exactly who you are."

It's been on T.V. before but I guess I was too young to appreciate or understand it's content. And now, I know what a great movie this is. Not only is it humourous, funny and heart-felt(is that a word?), but it's inspiring and entertaining and has good messages in it. Tom Hanks who I am now a big appreciative fan- is such a brilliant actor. He's amazing in all his roles and as Forrest Gump he was extroadinary. I've seen also quite  alot of his movies- Green mile, catch me if you can, Toy Story 1 and 2, you've got mail, castaway  but not really appreciated this fine actor. I mean with all the new generation 'heart-throb' actors who I like also and enjoy alot watching. But Tom has the experience. I have the DVD(2 disks) and it has everything, screen tests-which are sooo cute with Little Haley Joel Osmont and special effects which are so clever. I never really noticed how much work went into this and where it is computer generated you don't even notice.So, I give this movie a 5/5. It is a classic and one of my favourites.

I really didn't want to, because I find the film somewhat melancholy, but my girlfriend insisted.  Don't like movies that deal with death and loss all that much.I see a lot of differing opinions about this movie that it was about stupid people from the south, that it's a morality play, that it shows that anyone can succeed.I really don' think that the director wanted to have such a heavy handed obvious movie at all. This movie is like a painting, not a linear story. It was not about the South, Forest Gump, or Vietnam.  It was about life! There were parts of it that were silly, made me laugh, and yeah, tear up (when his mother was sick and dying).So, like every film ever made it has it's flaws and is imperfect.  It will work with some people and not with others.  But I found it to have moments, scenes of mesmerizing beauty that really got to a part of the human soul that a few movies try, but fail to reach."

The first scene, i.e., at the beginning of the film, one feather falling down to where Gump is sitting .It looks like a long and continuous moving scene. Even though you gaze at the feather (I ever did it), you could not tell whether it is true .The shade and reflection make it real. I am really confused the way to make the feather authentic. Beside of the technological miracle, the way the story tells is kind of self-reflection: Gump picks up the feather and puts it into a book. During the whole film, the feather has not been taken out any more until the end .So I am convinced easily that it is a comedy as leisurely as a feather. Definitely, the feather is one of highlights. Begin with the falling of the feather, Gump picks up the feather and begins to tell his experience to strangers. Afterward, he stands up and runs to find Jannie and his son. With the possession of the feather, something different from the former relation between Gump and Jannie: they ultimately marry each other and have the short happy time. Jannie dies of a serious disease. However, she leaves prosperity to Gump and his son, i.e., the prosperity for the next generation. The small family is kept after all (it seems to be prosperous). With the present of the feather, at the time when the old Gump sends his son to get on the school bus, the circle is made full and it is the end of the story. What¡¯s more, what I am thrilled is another revolution of directing: Gump is put into the historical events presenting with the historical big names, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, by switching the scenes of the old documentary with Forrest Gump, which is a milestone in film-making history."

We all know that this can never happen but, FORREST GUMP could. From going to the Vietnam war, owning his own shrimp boat, and meeting the president again. This movie when i first saw this movie i didn't really get I just thought it was just another movie about someone life but, when i saw again I got a different perspective of it. You can be a nobody and turn into a somebody. But enough sentimental stuff. It also had its comedy like " Are you stupid or something"? "Stupid is as stupid does sir". It also a movie about love. He was the greatest. I mean what wouldn't he do for jenny. Great movie."

Sign in to vote.,"Forrest Gump- timeless classic","Directed by Robert Zemekis, Forrest Gump is an endearing story of the trials and victories of Forrest (played by Tom Hanks) from the time he was a boy through adulthood, and an all-time fantastic movie. We see the challenges of being bullied as a young boy for being "different" from his peers, and we see how Forrest's mom (Sally Field) is his biggest cheerleader. We watch as he gets his one and only friend Jenny (Robin Wright Penn) and see their relationship blossom over the years. Forrest and Jenny "are best good friends" and are there for each other through all phases and stages of life. The layering of visible and invisible sound allows the viewer to actually feel as if they are present in the film. The use of creative editing makes the appearance that Forrest Gump is present for many of history's meaningful moments including the Vietnam War, being in the presence of President Nixon, President Kennedy, among other events. Tom Hanks' performance as Forrest Gump is one that will go down in the history books. His wisdom through innocence is what makes the viewer root for Forrest. There is sure to be tears and laughter as we go through Forrest's life experiences and trials alongside him."

Sign in to vote.,"forrest gump-truly meaningful","although many people thought that forrest gump was boring and were frustrated by forrest's simpleness, this movie is actually a great source of symbolism of how simpleness can lead to happiness. As viewed in certain religions, such as daoism, simpleness is the way to truth and understanding of how the world works. Forrest gump never tried to change things, and never had egotistic and meddlesome efforts to turn something into something else. This made his live simple and care-free, and ideal life style. Whenever he gained something, he did not take advantage of it or try to manipulate its powers. Instead, he accepted it, and if it happened to leave his hands, did not ponder over its departure. this attitude of life led him to be truly happy, something that is hard to do, even though it may not seem so. he never stopped loving, even though his friend from childhood took twists and turns and they grew their separate ways. It was a very touching movie. he took things as they came, never stopped loving,was truly happy, and that,therefore makes him one of the wisest human beings."

This is one of my favorite films of all time, and Tom Hanks is one of the greatest actors of our generation in my opinion and so I find it very difficult to see why people dislike it so much. The storyline itself is great, it's brilliant in its simplicity - basically the story of a young boy's life, and the amazing things he does with it. Each character brings something else to the story that adds to its brilliance and all the actors in it play their parts with the utmost talent, especially Tom Hanks and Robin Wright. As many of my friends know, I often watch this film burning with fury at Wright's character Jenny and the way she treats her supposed best friend Forest, and that is the sign of a good actress; someone who can really make you feel emotion towards the character they are playing. The same principle can be adopted with Tom Hanks; the first time I saw him sitting on that famous bench at the beginning, I felt a lump in throat. You cannot help but like the character, and no-one could have played him as well as Tom Hanks did. This film is a masterpiece, and one of the few truly good films of recent years. It deserved every Oscar that it received and I suggest to all those who don't like it, you must be missing something, as in my view it is impossible to not enjoy this film."

It takes time, to see what this film is all about.  The film is brilliant, because it starts of with a young boy, who is being told that he is not as good as the other children, because he isn't very clever.  His mum tells him he is as good as everyone else, and shouldn't feel inferior.  Forrest Gump uses his other talents and teaches by his mother to try his hardest at everything, and never looses faith and determination in anything that he did. This made him accomplish, so much when others would have thought he wouldn't do nothing with his life.People may see this film as a sentimental piece of trash, that makes us feel sorry for a idiot.  If you say this then you are not getting out of the movie what you should be doing.Tom Hanks is the nucleus of this movie, and played a brilliant part as Forrest.  I think Forrest, had a childlike innocence about him, which made him accomplish so much, because he only had the teachings of his mother to guide him in life, and he never saw the dangers, such has the war in Vietnam.The movie can't help to move you, especially when his mum and girlfriend dies, and when he finds out he's a father.  The movie has a brilliant sound-track, and never has a boring lull, it moves at a brilliant pace, and keeps you wanting more.I believe this is one of the great movies that has been made, because even though I am the biggest cynic of them all, even I cannot overlook the sheer brilliance, and imagination behind the movie.  This is a truly great movie that shouldn't be missed."

Especially the piano-theme in the beginning when we see this feather blowing through the air. "Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you gonna get", Forrest says, sitting on a bench talking to strangers. Strangers who listens to this guy telling his whole story. And the story is quite good. Tom Hanks does a fantastic job playing Forrest, and there' s actually a good reason why he was awarded with an Oscar for this role. The Director Of Photography, Don Burgess has also done a good job in this film, because some of the scenes in this film is like watching a beautiful painting or going to a museum. Very nice! Everyone out there who likes good films with a good story should definately see this film. Regards from Mr_Villmark"

It's been on T.V. before but I guess I was too young to appreciate or understand it's content. And now, I know what a great movie this is. Not only is it humourous, funny and heart-felt(is that a word?), but it's inspiring and entertaining and has good messages in it. Tom Hanks who I am now a big appreciative fan- is such a brilliant actor. He's amazing in all his roles and as Forrest Gump he was extradinary. I've seen also quite  alot of his movies- Green mile, catch me if you can, Toy Story 1 and 2, you've got mail, castaway  but not really appreciated this fine actor. I mean with all the new generation 'heart-throb' actors who I like also and enjoy alot watching. But Tom has the experience. I have the DVD(2 disks) and it has everything, screen tests-which are sooo cute with Little Haley Joel Osmont and special effects which are so clever. I never really noticed how much work went into this and where it is computer generated you don't even notice.So, I give this movie a 5/5. It is a classic and one of my favourites.

2,27-Jan-99,Cryofire,0,2,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"Forrest Gump: The kind of Genius we REALLY need!","First of all, Forrest Gump was an excellent film.  The emotions was real, the action was real, the characters were real, and plausible, some coincidences were extreme, but did nothing to hurt the movie.People seem to be angered at the fact that the character of Forrest Gump attains so much success, let alone his lack of "intelligence."  I believe this is the point that the author tried to make.  Forrest Gump may have had a childish, naive common sense, but he succeeded anyway, and with flying colours.  His innocence kept him from being tempted by greed, thus hurting himself and others. Honestly, if there were more Forrest Gumps  around, the world would be a better place (don't mean to sound sentimental).All the characters are used well to convey the image of the time.  Forrest's mother, and old-fashioned, good-hearted lady is typical of the time.  Jenny, falling into a drug crazed orgy during the seventies, pays for it by contracting AIDs a plausible fate for her actions.  Lieutenant Dan, a typical war vet, whom sees no reason for life without the ability to be normal shows us how to respect life in it's fullest.  Bubba, the sentiment character who is killed in battle at Forrest's side, leads to further events in the story well.The theme of success, happiness and awe of the world is well portrayed in the "running" scene where Forrest runs across america twofold.And possibly the most subtle, yet important theme of running away, is used with excellence.  From "Run Forrest, Run" to the scene with Forrest carrying Bubba from battle, to the football antics, and finally the "Run across america" scenes are genius.   Forrest was always a good runner, running away from his fears, running away from himself and running away from the truth. The one thing he did not run away from was Jenny, in fact he was running to Jenny. This emotional love-story may be a little "storybook" but it shows the power of love in everyone, even the handicapped.This film was excellent, I don't see how anyone could give it anything under 7/10 stars.I personally give it 9/10."

Sign in to vote.,"Story of Lovable Forrest in the world full of imperfections and selfishness","Dear Friends , I read all of these comments on Forrest Gump. I respect all these views . As for my opinion I think I have never seen anything like that. This was a perfect masterpiece. It would be very unjustified if I praise the movie as its virtue needs no mention. I would rather take up the criticisms expressed. First, Tom Hanks played Gump too brilliantly. Many think that playing Psycho or fool is simple. It is not. Forrest is not stupid. He is just not a ''SMART MAN'' as he himself knows. Gump is an innocent Simpleton. None but Hanks could have done the justice to this character. Second , it is not celebration of stupidity. It is depiction of our imperfect world through the eyes and mind of Forrest. Everyone around him is imperfect ,especially Jenny (we will come to her later). Forrest is the master of his own time and fate.It would be very wrong to find didactic messages in the movie. It is a work of art and should be savored and enjoyed instead of being analyzed. There are some unbelievable episodes and incidents...But why should we murder the beauty only to dissect and analyze ??? Call such parts as Celluloid licenses. This is the movie that makes you laugh and cry at the same time. Forrest's quotes such as , ''Life is a box of chocolates..'' should not be put under scrutiny like quotes from Shakespeare or T.S. Elliot !! He himself says that his mum always tells him things the way he understands them...Now we come to Jenny. She does not have to be goddess. She is one of many imperfect persons showed in the movie. She does love Forrest but is embarrassed and reluctant to share her life with him. She keeps on telling him that she has a life very different from his. Any person in Jenny's place would have done the same. But she has always loved him from childhood to adulthood. In the end when she meets Forrest with a kid and a most Possibly AIDS ,She assures him that she demands nothing from him and can support her child. She is reformed after making mistakes all through her life and learning from them. Maybe she got AIDS after she made love to Forrest and maybe after she gave Birth to Forrest Jr. ? Anyway , this is perhaps the biggest Celluloid license in the movie and we could ignore it.I do not have any particular favorite scenes in the movie as I love the whole movie . But still if I have to mention ....I would say that the last one when Forrest talks to Jenny while she rests in peace in her grave was very touching. Interestingly her Epitaph describes her as the Wife and mother of Forrest Gump, Which is very sweet and touching and true. And Forrest again made me cry when he shows Jenny a letter from Forrest Junior but moments later he made me laugh when he says that he is not going to read or open it because Junior wanted him not to ! :-) I will always love this movie and this is the story of our own imperfect world in contrast with Forrest's near perfect and most innocent world....almost an Arcadia of its own kind....."

Sign in to vote.,"There's a little Forrest Gump in all of us","After a bout of depression I indulged in a moment of quiet self-reflection, and I remembered how Forrest Gump ran across the United States and simply rationalizes the trend he set: "I just felt like running." Some things are best done and for reasons we don't know why and I think a simpleton personality like Forrest's is something adults overlook and take for granted.He represents a symbol of how losing self-consciousness is often the road to happiness and also that living is of just doing and not questioning "why?" all the time. Of course, it would be near impossible for the resume of events to occur in the life of one man, but the message reaches to everyone who got into decisions attributed to pure innocence and good heartedness and came out triumphant. Reminder that there's a little of Forrest in all of us- a balancer of the often-serious life society dictates the selfish messages of "survival of the fittest". Good messages to anyone who needs a little boost to a bad day."

2,27-Sep-00,gclapper,1,4,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"2 points regarding the power of this film","I want to make two observations that I have not seen in the over 160 reviews of this film that I just read on this site.1)  One thing that Forrest does not embody, something which our culture is drowning in, is sarcasm.  (For accessible examples, read many of the reviews for this film!)  That is one of the reasons people find it surprisingly moving.  If you watch a lot of popular movies, not to mention sitcom TV, you might think that sarcasm is the natural idiom of communication.  But then, when someone actually asserts something and takes a stand for something (other than self-seeking sex or egotistical domination) without a whiff of sarcasm, the effect can be stunning.We have forgotten that sarcasm is parasitic on somebody actually asserting something.  To cut through the garbage of life we should be able to distance ourselves from the false parts of it, and that is what sarcasm does.  But sarcasm cannot assert anything except its derision of someone else's assertion.  It is derivative and parasitic.  To see someone who is without sarcasm, as we see in Gump, can be an eye-opening and truly moving experience, opening us to a vision of life where there is something to believe in, and not just something to mock.This is not a question of Gump's (low) intelligence, though our culture often likes to think that sarcasm is the sine qua non of intelligence.  It is about a desire to commit and risk.  Sarcasm falls silent in the face of life honestly lived in adherence to values worth striving after.  Hence, all we are left with are tears when we see someone without sarcasm and guile who lives a life of loyalty and love.2) The recitation of recent history may seem a frivolous excuse for a few jokes, but the whole point of it detonates in the penultimate scene where Forrest talks to Jenny's grave.  He asks "Is it Lieutenant Dan who is right, or is it Momma?" (or words to that effect).  He is asking if we are all fated in a predeterministic way or if we are truly free to make our own destiny.  His answer--"I think its both"--rings true for many people, and hence is a powerful comment on all of life.  Both the capriciousness of history and a sense of something coming from it are acknowledged, and that speaks to me.The feather seems to be blown around randomly, but it comes to rest in strategic places.  God's grace works within the context of our human freedom, and, in the end, this is a film about grace."

2,7-Jan-11,mahdiyeh82,1,2,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"Forrest Gump","Forrest GumpForrest: My momma always said,"life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get."It is a 1994 American comedy-drama film based on a novel of the same name by Winston Groom. The film is directed by Robert Zemeckis, staring Tom Hanks, Robin Wright and Gary Sinise. The story is of the Forrest Gump, a man from Alabama, his travels all over the world and the experiences he has had in his life. The film was first released in the United States on July 6, 1994, and was well received by critics. It earned over $677 million worldwide. The film garnered multiple awards and nominations, including Academy Awards, Golden Globe Awards, People's Choice Awards, and Young Artist Awards. The film starts by showing a feather floating in the sky and coming to Forrest's shoes. Then we see Forrest, sitting at a bus stop, taking the feather and telling his life story to the woman sitting next to him. As he tells his story, the listeners at bus stop change. Some of them are indifferent; some do not believe him while some others are interested and even fascinated. He was born with strong legs as we see later but with a crooked spine. The first day of school he met Jenny, the girl who changed his life. Once while they were walking among the trees, some boys tried to bully him. Jenny shouted" run Forrest, run" he started running and tore the strings which tied his special shoes. From that time on we see that his special ability and talent is running. While in college, again he was bullied by some boys, and this time ran through football field where he was recognized by the coach and invited to the team. After that he was taken to arm where he met his best friend Bouba who died later on in Vietnam. He saved some lives and also got wounded during the war and when he came back he received a Medal of Honor. While in hospital, his hobby was playing ping pong. He became a member of Army's team and went to China and won the competition with the Chinese and became a national hero. During his life he met different presidents and other famous people like John Lennon. All his life he was in love with Jenny and finally he married she and they had a son whom she had called Forrest. He started his shrimp business and became successful in it. Then through Lit. Dan, who he had met during war, invested some money in other businesses but went back to his hometown and lived with his momma till she died. For some years he was running without any reason. After Jenny's death he continued his life bringing up his son. It seems as if the feather which is carried by the breeze and is left in its hands and goes wherever is taken, is Forrest himself who is moved all his life by others. In the film in a scene when he was talking to Jenny's grave he was wondering "if we are all just floating around accidental-like on a breeze". The first days of his life it was his mother who told him what to do or not to do. Later it was Jenny who took up the role and it was by her demand that he even overcame his physical problem. This shows itself so vividly in Forrest's first encounter with Drill Sergeant when he answers the Sergeant that he was there" to do whatever you tell me, Drill Sergeant!". Even his success in ping pong was due to the fact that the first day he was told not to take his eyes off the ball.The times he starts doing something without others ordering him, the action is misled by others. It can be shown best in his period of life when he started running. At first nobody paid attention to him but after a while he was surrounded by lots of reporters who tried to label him by some movement. Although he was completely ignorant, the answers he gave to those questions inspired some people. In the process, he forms the iconic"simply face" logo and tells the man to "Have a nice day". This way others try to control his actions.Although he had no plan, by his actions, which sometimes even seemed stupid, he changed the way of American history. While staying with President Nixon in Watergate hotel, it was by his phone call that the security office was informed of what was going on there and it initiated the Watergate scandal. In his interview with Dick Cavett, where John Lennon was a guest too, his answers inspired Lennon to write his famous song "imagine". Finally we can say he was an individual who had no will. When he was in love, he was treated in a way he even did not know his feeling and later on when he was told the child was his, he accepted it without hesitation. He was an individual who was affected by collective will. Whenever they wanted they sent him to war and when they were tired of war they took him to anti-war meeting to talk against war. During Cold War he was sent to China to beat the enemy in sport field. He is the individual human being without any will who is taken wherever he is destined to."

How flawed can a movie be when it takes a man through college football, Vietnam, ping pong, shrimping, and running several times across America?  Everybody from Elvis to Abbie Hoffman to Nixon to Kennedy to John Lennon to Dick Cavett to Lyndon Johnson make surprising and pleasant appearances.  While the film may be slightly exaggerated to keep this guy moving, the two hours of film "Forrest Gump" uses are spent giving us the best summation of pop culture and textbook history we're probably ever going to see.  And through it all, Forrest continually turns to his best friend Jenny, who sees Forrest as a good friend who doesn't know any better, which is why she tries so hard to maintain her innocence around her IQ-troubled friend.  While Forrest may never fully realize the 30-something years of history he encounters, he does recognize friends and family as the real center of the world, which is played out beautifully in the last scene, which hands the baton to a new generation of kids who may be more socially aware than their parents.  "Forrest Gump" is a must-have for anyone who enjoys people and movies."

Forrest Gump stays true to himself till the very end of the movie thought he realizes that he is not as smart as other people. This understanding makes him able to accept anything that happens in his life and be "strong". The theme of "Forrest Gump" seems to be easy but at the same time it is very serious because it touches important issues such as war, not being like other people, fight for the right to be equal and many others. Hanks won his second Best Actor Academy Award for his role in Forrest Gump. Tom Hanks is a wonderful actor that he gets into the skin of Forrest Gump's silly role. He expresses a wide range of emotion that I empathize with his acting. In the beginning of "Forrest Gump" -- "Life's like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get." This is with a young nurse gives a hint what the main actor's life will be. ). Forrest Gump is very strong as it strives for fighting the stereotype of discriminating disabled people. It may be said that it is one of the greatest movies"

Forrest, the simpleton, is representative of the simple man; everyman, and Jenny is a '60s seeker'. Forrest goes through life as most of us do: living, loving, meeting his obligations, whereas, Jenny, is constantly seeking, and finally finds that what is meaningful has always been within her reach.Winston Groom wrote the acclaimed Vietnam War novel Better Times Than These, the prize-winning As Summers Die, and co-authored Conversations with the Enemy, which was nominated for a 1984 Pulitzer Prize. He is also the author of the No.1 New York Times bestsellers Forrest Gump and Gumpisms: The Wit and Wisdom of Forrest Gump. Mr Groom's Shrouds of Glory, an account of Confederate General John Bell Hood's decisive actions in the last great campaign of the US Civil War, was published in April, 1995. He lives in New York City and Point Clear, Alabama.I find it terrific that this 'best political' movie escaped, Hollywood unnoticed."

There are many scenes with an intensity witch you car rarely watch in the universe of the movies. The way Tom Hanks conduce Forrest make us believe in a kind of behavior witch is very uncommon, but possible in a human being. Besides, there are many beautiful scenes that make any sensitive person in tears. Forrest Gump loves Jenny Curran since they were children, and she takes years to understand it and even feel the same, but after she dies, one day he goes to her splutter, and there is wrote "Jenny Gump". The poetry in this final scene is something that no other love story may have. About the relationship between Forrest and his mother, the movie shows the true perfection in every mother's love in the world."

This movie is (quite possibly) the WORST adaptation of a book to a "film". When it was first announced that Forrest Gump was going to be adapted for the screen, I was very excited, as this was one of my favorite stories. I cannot begin to describe the nausea that overcame me as I sat through the slaughter of Winston Groom's literary masterpiece (tall tale of the tallest). I was completely embarrassed in front of my friends (whom I had dragged along to the movie theater with me); I had to urge them to read the book and forget what they had witnessed on the screen. Everything about this movie, from the casting to the "rewriting", was just plain wrong. It was as if the powers that be at the studio were waiting for someone in the audience to jump up and say: "THE EMPEROR IS NAKED", but(secretly) knew that the sheep would even eat weeds."

On the one hand, this is a man with mental disabilities, but on the other hand, this is a unique person whose superiority sometimes cannot be compared with an ordinary person, whose kindest heart gave birth to the most amazing deeds. Despite the health problems, this unique character has won many victories in life, which is impossible for a healthy person. He became the best amateur athlete of the USA in football, a hero of the Vietnam War, also Gump won an international table tennis tournament in China, and made a great contribution to the lives of many people by donating to the construction of a church and a medical center.

He called the movie a dupe because of its over-hyped publicity and positive reviews, and gave reasons why he felt the film was not great, but instead "just above mediocre".  However, his reasons did not prove to me that the film was not great, it just proved that this is not the kind of film that he enjoys. Using his logic, I could say that Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon was not a great film because I do not enjoy movies with sub-titles.  This of course does not prove that the film is not great, but rather proves that it's just a film that I wouldn't enjoy personally.Forrest Gump is not an exercise in mush and sentimentality, as Mr. Morgan put it, but rather a well-directed, well-acted masterpiece.  It is a coming of age story about a man who succeeds in each phase of life despite obvious disadvantages.  It has a wonderful story, a top-notch soundtrack, and fantastic images of war, post-war, and 1960's through 80's America."

It is just a story,but a amazing story about amazing person.His name is Forrest Gump. He is not a normal person because he is, well somebody assumes that,very dumb. Certainly, that is not the main aspect of the movie. Forrest Gump make his life become a modern fairy tale when from a disable child to the famous footballer and soldier. In his mind,nothing important than his mother and Jenny, his closet friend and loved girl friend.Forrest Gump never use violence to solve problems.However, he did it one time because one stupid guy insult Jenny.I really like his sentence, "I don't know what is love,but I love you." The lesson I took from this movie and Forres Gump personally is we can do anything we want. Do not hesitate,whether our decision is right or wrong,just do it.It will help us to be more mature.I like this film very much because it is so humane"

But you probably know that already, even if you haven't seen any of the three instalments of Keanu Reeves's inimitable portrayal of this iconic pop culture figure. And "John Wick 4" is coming. You can bet on that.People talk about the movie's gory violence, but if you are a fan of "Game of Thrones", you are probably immune to violence on screen. As to chopping off a finger to show repentance, it is as old as at least 1989, insofar as the Hollywood screen is concerned. You know what I mean if you have seen Michael Douglas's "Black Rain" (1989) which, among other things, features the Japanese underworld.Therefore, I submit that JW3's violence is remarkable not because of its goriness, but because of its ingenuity. Let me give three examples just from the first three action sequences, which are merely preludes to a parade of an endless procession of superbly choregraphed action sequences.Case 1: jamming a 2-inch book into a guy's mouth and pounding it in like what one does with a chisel. Case 2: crashing pane after pane of glass to use shards as if they were flying daggers. Case 3: punching a horse's belly with a hard fist to trigger hind kicks as lethal weapon. And, as I said, these are just prelude.Briefly, on plotline, the story continues from the two prior instalments, with Wick now a fugitive from the High Table (an organization not unlike The League of Assassins, if you are a follower of the TV series "Arrow") that designates him "excommunicado", with a 14 million dollar contract out on him. Starting from the Continental Hotel in Manhattan, his journey via Casablanca and the Sahara comes full circle, back to the hotel where the grand finale set piece unfolds. Along the way he receives help from people who are powerful enough to take a risk, but not enough to avoid punishment dealt out by the High Table as appropriate. Some of these scenes are bloody funny, in both the idiomatic and literal senses.In addition to the action which should satisfy the franchise fans, there are some interesting characters, both returning and new ones. Ian McShane and Lance Reddick reprise their roles of manager and right-hand man of The Continental. Laurence Fishburne is again the Bowery King. These three will definitely team up with Wick in "chapter 4" in a showdown with the High Table. I am particularly happy to see Anjelica Huston in an almost cameo role here. Among her countless films, the one I remember most is "The Dead" (1987), an excellent rendition of a singularly moving short story in James Joyce's "Dubliners"."

Sign in to vote.,"Enjoyably choreographed, but the lack of consequence combined with the global scale robs it of urgency and means it outstays its welcome a bit","It is 5 years since the first John Wick film - one that took me by surprise by how silly it was as a narrative, but yet how well it delivered action sequences. The second film was only 2 years ago, and it raised the stakes and went from a man seeking revenge on another group of people, into one where the world was filled with assassins, popping up from everywhere all the time. I remember ending that film feeling like it had gone too far but that the third would probably do more of that. True enough, Parabellum ("prepare for war") sees the whole world filled with assassins, and a huge administrative system around them - but yet the whole lot of them can't seem to cause John Wick too much trouble. As with the first film, this expands the world more than it can bear, and although it looks cool at times, the world makes no sense whatsoever and it hurts the film the more it relies on it (which it does as it expands it).The simplicity of the first film is therefore gone, and the slick fun is hurt because it feels bloated in scale, and has to work to sell this unsellable world to the viewer. At its best though, the film doesn't concern itself with this and instead has nicely flowing sequences of well-choreographed violence that is well directed and performed. It is brutally violent but it is almost like a ballet to watch it. Having two cast members from The Raid films had the positive impact of having them, but there was a negative too because those films manage to deliver stakes and tension in the violence - something John Wick just doesn't manage to ever do. I enjoyed the flow and pace, but never got caught up in a fight in a way where it had me on the edge of the seat; contrast the fight with Yayan Ruhian and Cecep Arif Rahman, and the fights that the two are involved with in The Raid 1 and 2 respectively - their John Wick fight is enjoyable but their fights in The Raid movies had weight, danger, and risk.The endless lack of consequence does make it hard to stay engaged with, and it needs it to be cool and slick so that we never connect it to the real world - but seeing people stabbed in a busy train station with people just walking by without reaction does make that hard, for example. It is still slick, quite enjoyable tosh, and very well put together in terms of fight sequences, but it does feel bloated and overlong, and could have done with a tighter world - although I guess they cannot put that back in the box after the second movie took it out. Enjoyable for what it is, but it has a lot of weaknesses that detract while watching."

3,14-Sep-21,Johnny_West,5,6,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"Hilarious Overkill","The story of vengeance on anyone that ever helped Wick is kind of stupid. Everyone helped him before he was excommunicated, so why are they being punished? I guess it is so there can be another sequel.John Wick gets shot at least six times. He also gets stabbed several times. This movie represents a day or two of continuous action, as Wick is pursued by hundreds of fellow assassins who want the $15 million bounty for his death. In spite of taking so many shots, Wick fights in hand-to-hand combat with dozens of lethal killers. The action is insane. Wick on numerous occasions shoots somebody in the chest, and then saunters by and shoots the same guy three or four times in the head. WTF?Even though Wick is constantly changing ammo magazines, it was impossible to keep up with all the ammo he was wasting. 4-5 shots per person multiplied by 60-75 enemies killed is over 350 rounds of ammo. That would be 22 clips even if he used a Glock 17, which he did not. Using what looked like 9mm semi-automatic pistols, it would take 35+ magazines to do all the killing he did. He would have need to push a cart full of ammo clips.Overall this movie was fun just to watch 75-100 characters get killed off. The funny part is that there are three dogs roaming the various killing zones, with hundreds of bullets zipping by, and none of them are injured."

We've seen more exciting of each many times. There's no new ground here, no stunts in the Tom Cruise sense to speak of. No risks at all.Fightwise, the only novelty we have that is now already a brand is our character's damage that somehow transcends the challenges. So don't come for the action. Come for the world-building.It is astonishingly compelling, extended from the 'Godfather' tradition of 'rules and consequences'. It is comically extreme but consistent and logical. I can recommend this because of the thought that went into the creation of the world and the elaborate setup for the next film. That setup is tantalising.The idea that what keeps him going, pushes him through is personally attractive. He wants to live to remember his wife."

I especially liked how the expanded the lore so much, and then at some point realized that "ok, this is not an ending to a trilogy, its a beginning for a new one". So many new characters, some even left alive.Keanu Reeves is just amazing.The way he walks, talks and of course fights. I loved his aswer to question "What do you need?" A fun callback to his legendary role.All cast members did well too, from the old ones to all new ones. Especially Asia Kate Dillon as The Adjudicator managed to be quite menacing, also Mark Dacascos as Zero was both fun and a really good fighter, those high kicks and the speed of movement, wow. Halle Berry, in her small role, did the action very well. Laurence Fishburne was chewing the scenes as an all-knowing "Morpheus".But the highest praise goes to the director, the stunt team, the fight choreographers and the people lighting and staging the scenes. I was kind of waiting to get bored of the endless shooting and hitting, but they managed to keep it thoroughly entertaining and visually stunning. So many memorable fights in here.One minor gripe about the direction though - in the static scenes they could have used more close up pictures, and maybe slightly different camera angles. The Casablanca scene with "Bronn" was kind of bland.The call centers with tattooed women and old Commodore 64 computers and such were a fun detail in the lore.Looking forward to John Wick 4 and 5!"

It's not a lack of support or funds, the movie has already proven to be successful. It's not a lack of GOOD writers or directors - anybody would want to be associated with an already proven success. No, I believe it comes down to profit and the holy dollar. That's the only reason I can find for why Hollywood knowingly continues to create crapping sequels, over and over and over again. Put as little money in as possible to make the profit bigger and hope the masses just buy it on name alone.Before I mention what I believe is wrong with this movie, let me say the one RIGHT thing about this movie were the sets and beautiful cinematography. Absolutely stunning and gorgeous!Instead of investing in a good script, with a good story and definition of characters - those 'above the table' on this film decided to see how many fight scenes they could pack into 2 hours. Not good fight scenes mind you - BORING, horribly acted and choreographed fight scenes. By the third or fourth fight scene - you literally find yourself checking how much time is left in the film and saying a silent prayer that it ends. This is the last thing I thought I would be thinking after waiting months to see this film. Sad. It could have been completely different. I understand this is "John Wick" - there must be fight scenes - but for the love of God - why couldn't they had made them more interesting?? Well directed and acted? Did I say Interesting? Maybe have one end before the 20 minute mark?? Would that have been so hard?This could have been a great movie. Should have been a great movie, but instead - it went completely of course and nobody ever pulled it back."

Delivering on its promise, this is pretty straightforward with brutally outlandish hand-to-hand fighting, some innovative and exciting chase scenes, not to mention efficient use of its animals! When it stops for exposition and attempts at character building it's not that interesting, but there are some inspired casting choices, and the relentless, ultraviolent, over-the-top action set pieces pack quite a punch. Reeves is willing to take punishment in just about any way, shape, or form, but fortunately dishes it out in equal measure. **½"

As expected, the action scene choreography, camera work and the semi-cyberpunk atmosphere are a solid step up from previous instalments. Unfortunately for the fans of the first John Wick movie, this one does not establish John as a semi-realistic and vulnerable character: while the ongoing fight-scenes are a great fun, the suspension of disbelief really kicks in after the second act. The acting is good, the writing is mediocre (it serves just one purpose - to drive the action scenes of the movie, nothing more). The flaws of the movie, however, are greatly compensated by the great overall technical execution of the film.It seems that Lionsgate decided to turn this franchise with its main character into a cash-cow, postponing the conclusion of John Wicks story-arc for the future films, which is not a bad thing if they manage to keep the quality at this level."

Sign in to vote.,"Timely and driven by a great lead performance and cinematic reference, even if it is not as smart as some would have you believe (SPOILER)","Low expectations and subverted expectations play a big part in this film's success, although not the biggest part. The levels of expectation on a DC 'universe' film is now pretty low - to the point that someone with film OCD like myself has not bothered to even dip a toe in recent years; likewise what one expects from a superhero genre origin story is not something like this. The sense of pleasant surprise certainly helped the success of the film, but it is not the main thing.The main reason is the central performance of Phoenix. He is totally committed to selling his character throughout, and even in the weakest moments of narrative, you believe his character in terms of its roots, development, and actions. It is not a film that would normally be associated with awards, but it would be a significant failure were he not to be recognized for how much he delivered and how much he made the film. A secondary reason the film works is its cinematic heritage in the films of Scorsese in so much as it falls between Taxi Driver and King of Comedy. This is not accidental, and the casting deserve a lot of credit of getting actors of the quality of Phoenix and de Niro (although the latter does more as a reference than an actor). With these elements working well, the film produces an engaging origin story that feels responsible but yet fitting the character. I could have done with it stopping just a few seconds earlier than it did, because I'm not sure that the "maybe it was all imagined" bit at the end was a good idea.Otherwise, it is enjoyably dark and deliberate, and is driven by Phoenix, even if the film is not as brilliant as some would have you believe."

There are endless shots of a solitary, anguished Joaquin Phoenix, which get pretty monotonous.In a nutshell: adopted boy suffers brain damage from a brutal father, lives with a sick mentally ill mother, and, after getting beat-up by street hooligans, builds a self-pitying clown alter-ego that's going to hold up a mirror to a dismissive society. *Yawn*Of all the actors who have played Joker, Heath Ledger got the right balance of being a scary, crazed, murderous, diabolically clever sociopath who could go toe-to-toe with Batman. The pathetic, hapless Phoenix character lacks all of that persona.Yes, Phoenix does an outstanding performance worthy of an Oscar. But that alone doesn't save a film that is a boring flop because it is monotone, dark, dour, and mostly pointless."

That being said, I was disappointed that they painted the joker as someone with a schizophrenic disorder. The stigma of mental illness is already a problem that plagues society, it's disappointing for Hollywood to continue to endorse the negative stigma. In reality, the majority of crimes are not committed by people who are mentally ill. Also, there is no way they would have stopped a persons medicine cold turkey just because they ran out of funds. They always refer them to someone who can fill their medication, especially when someone is severely mentally ill. In reality, the social worker who didn't refer him to someone would have been held legally liable for the murders."

Sign in to vote.,""I hope my death makes more cents than my life." - Arthur's diary of jokes","The aura of Joaquin Phoenix at work again in this standalone 'drama' by Todd Phillips. The word 'drama' is important for this movie in particular because if you're looking for the conventional madness and the psychopathetic phenomenon that the name "Joker" always brings, you would be disappointed. Joker is as much a movie about Arthur's fall as it is about Joker's rise. For the most part of the 121 minutes, we see this really poor and pathetic figure of Arthur Fleck, living with his single-mother in a not-so-pretty apartment, and working amidst continuous abuse and ignorance of the rich kids of Gotham City, while struggling to make it as a stand-up comedian. Arthur Fleck is the typical portrayal of the left-out loner, who is beaten down by the unforgiving capitalist society, and finally able to assert power and control by means of violence. This is not a new concept. But, the real deal is the way Phoenix makes the character his own. The whole movie is seen from Phoenix's (Arthur's) point of view, and I could not find a scene as such in which he is not present. It is not so easy to really convince the fans of 'The Dark Knight' trilogy that Joker could be someone other than the exceptional Heath. But, somehow, Joaquin Phoenix as Joker, right from its announcement, seemed right. He is phenomenal throughout the movie. The screeching laughter which looked physically very troubling for the actor to execute on so many occasions, is going to be remembered for sometime. Only someone as eccentric as Phoenix could've made this kind of a portrayal possible.However, there are a couple of things which needs to be addressed here. Firstly, the divided opinions about the movie, with many of the critics questioning the negative message that this movie sends to the audience. The argument of the nihilistic portrayal and making violence fashionable through this movie is really devoid of sense. This is not the first movie and won't be the last to portray violence. Secondly, and this makes more sense than the previous, the movie does not really have much in it besides Phoenix's brilliance. Not much happens for the most part of the movie, except for Arthur's painful laughter and somewhat catchy dance-moves. That being said, the movie does end on a high with the metamorphosis of Arthur into Joker taking centre stage and chaos unleashed.This one leaves us with hope for something bigger and surely, the next installment will see the Joker we all saw and loved through the years.This is not a movie about Joker, it is a movie about Arthur. Remember this and you'll love it."

The movie had become so publicised that just about everything that can be said about it has been said. Whether that has taken it into the spoiler-immune region I cannot say. Still, I have inserted the regular a spoiler alert.The movie opens with clear establishing scenes including his case social worker reassuring Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) that she understands he is having a "tough time", just coming out of psychiatric hospital and is currently on seven different medications. He carries a card to show people in public that he has "a condition", whenever he breaks out in uncontrollable fits of laughter.Fleck is a professional clown and he particularly enjoys the visits to children in hospital. Walking around in public dressed as a clown often attracts hostile reactions which sometimes end up in his being beaten. One of his co-workers gives him a gun for self-protection. And Chekov's infinite wisdom proves true again as he shoots and kills three half-drunk white-collar thugs who attack him in a subway carI wouldn't go into the depressing and often gruesome details of the simple plot development. A key thing to note is that devoted to caring for his invalid mother, it is absolutely devastating for him to discover that she had always been crazy and had condoned the abused from his stepfather in his traumatising childhood. He kills (undetected) his mother in hospital.Up to this point, the protagonist still has the audience's sympathy, at least to some degree. But when is savagely kills a well-meaning co-worker coming to see if he need any help, this character is lost even to the audience. For one, I don't care anymore what happens.There is a good slightly more than cameo appearance of Robert De Niro. And nobody is doing to deny that Phoenix deserves his Oscar. But I would rather see him win uth with his portrayal of Johnny Cash in "Walk the line" ("

Sign in to vote.,"A really important film at frightening times","Never was there a more pertinent film for a time when society is beginning to fragment and people are becoming disenfranchised from family, core human values and love. Joker is not a 'Batman' type movie of the super hero genre; no, its much more important than that. Joker is not make believe; it's real. It's happening all around us and all over the world. Yet what is happening simultaneously, are the incredible webs of lies and deceit that are spun to delude and keep the truth down.Joachim Phoenix delivers an incredible performance that is central to the film's success. Bet he won't win an Oscar though because the liberal elite will find this film a tad hard to swallow. Liberal feedback is that the film is too violent however the trailers before this film started were 'acceptable' violence of endless garbage gratuitous films for the brain dead. Joker is a symbol of all those people in the world who are not cared for, loved or cherished - firstly by their nearest and dearest and then by society itself. When these people begin to disintegrate, we walk straight past them; be they addicts, homeless, refugees, mentally ill and the suchlike. Social media has only ingrained humanity's ability to isolate and take advantage of people's weaknesses or to downright use people to make money and so the 'super elite' are born. The super elite are the version (rats are everywhere in Gotham) who prey on the filth all around them. As we see Joker begin his downward spiral in to severe mental illness we can only lament that this illness permeates every part of media and politics and drug companies and crime of modern society. Joker leaves one question unanswered - where do we got from here?"

The most annoying being how the Joker is portrayed. While there are many interpretations of Joker. This one goes with. 'Oh he's got mental issues' while that's not what makes Joker crazy. This form of chaos that exists to add some spice to the grey void that is life.The talk show host. Thomas Wayne. His mom. Are main characters of sorts but i'm not given any reason to care for them. Joker's You get what you f--king deserve moment. Is just so funny because it makes so little sense. I would say almost this film is trying to take Mr. Robot elements and morph them with the joker to get something new. And while it is new it isn't a movie. More of social commentary. Which at times is forced down your throat about how. The big guy doesn't care about us.Joker being kicked around and going on a murder spree isn't this act of liberation. With the end scene it feels like a school shooter story. With a guy with anger issues fighting back at those who hurt him. He's now just an angry teenager especially with the last mind."

Programs to support them are rarely cancelled and handicapped peopleof all kinds get protected employments.So I could not really connect with the premises, but hey, it's Gotham, isn't it ? A town that is supposed to be a fictional NewChicagomerica, where everything can happen. Therefore the most dumb storyline one can imagine can happen also, and it does.So for me 'Joker' is only 4 stars, with 4 of them going to J. Phoenix, who did a great Job in saving a development story single-handedly, that seems to be written by substage pupils."

4,17-Oct-19,gortx,0,1,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"JOKER a dark bleak origin story with lots of 70s references","JOKERWhen Martin Scorsese's name got linked as a producer on this DC Comics spin-off movie, many people were flabbergasted. Scorsese? A Superhero flick?* In retrospect, once one sees the end result it makes a certain amount of sense. Much of JOKER plays like an alternate universe conglomeration of TAXI DRIVER and KING OF COMEDY (with healthy doses of MEAN STREETS and AFTER HOURS in the stew). Director and Co-Writer Todd Phillips and his partner Scott Silver cleverly weave in the origin story of the super-villain into this alternate reality.Joaquin Phoenix plays Arthur Fleck, a sad sack with psychological issues. So, of course, he's working as a for hire clown who spreads his anti-joy to those unfortunate to witness his services. Fleck lives with his ailing mother Penny (Frances Conroy). Fleck has dreams of becoming a stand up comedian, and , after a particularly awkward trial set, he ends up as a guest on a late night talk show hosted by none other than -- Rupert Pupkin himself, Robert DeNiro (as Murray Franklin). Also lurking around Fleck's purvueis a certain rich millionaire Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) and his son, uh, Bruce (Dante Pereira-Olson).At this point it must be stressed that JOKER's screenplay and direction use the form of the (highly) unreliable narrator in telling its tale. Sometimes, the deception is clear. At other times, not so much, to the point where one can't be certain. For the most part, it's a smart strategy. The movie succeeds in keeping the viewer off-balance even if one is fairly certain where its ultimately headed.Phoenix has long been one of cinema's most quirky and unusual leading men. As if to prove his bona fides as an eccentric, he even once pulled a year long stunt where he 'quit' acting to become a full-time rapper. Here his unpredictability is keenly used to the movie's advantage. Phoenix contorts and bends his body, and curls his facial muscles almost as if it were against his will. It's a physical transformation so complete, that the Joker clown makeup is almost superfluous.JOKER exerts it grungy attitude in an effective manner for the first two acts. It's a dark bleak vision where the DC origins are almost unnecessary. The streets are crime ridden and literally filled with piles of garbage. Other than the references to Gotham City and the Wayne family, it genuinely feels apart from the superhero machine. Unfortunately, Phillips and Silver have to not only shoe-horn in the comic book elements, but, in doing so they also become too confidant of their ability to give the movie false gravitas. Not content with paying homage to the Scorsese quartet, JOKER also weaves in DEATH WISH, and ultimately NETWORK (and not to the present movie's advantage). It feels force and Fleck/Joker's words begin to feel false and over-written (V FOR VENDETTA achieved similar conclusions much more smoothly and organically). The too on the nose song score also gets to be a bit much.Despite the weak third act, JOKER is still a movie to be reckoned with. Missteps aside, it a jarring addition to mainstream blockbuster movie-making. Even if one isn't as seeped in the films of the 70s and early 80s** it's a daunting vision even it can't fully pull it off.* In the end, it didn't happen, of course. The current 'official story' is that Scorsese was approached because the movie was to be set in NYC and it was thought his connections and production savvy could smooth the way for an easier shoot. He demurred in the end.** Along with the titles mentioned, JOKER evokes such 70s crime films as THE TAKING OF PELHAM 1,2,3 and THE FRENCH CONNECTION. That's why it's a bit of surprise when it's revealed that it actually seems to take place in 1981 (references to the films WOLFEN and ZORRO THE GAY BLADE set the date)."

We know Joker is descending into madness, yet the filmmakers make this process new and surprising at every turn.Phoenix, one of the best actors in Hollywood, has surpassed himself.My only criticism is the ending. The mental hospital scene derailed the future this movie portends. I would have ended it after the street corner scene where Joker stands on the car and revels in his new-found glory."

His maniacal, grotesque Joker is truly frightening. He took command of this character down to his contorted movement and his off kilter laugh. This is a dark and twisted movie, a sad social commentary on society and those struggling with mental health. There was nothing comic-booky about this movie it's raw and visceral and quite disturbing much more like Taxi Driver. There were some plot holes but the cinematography was beautiful and I liked the delusional girl friend. Interesting to see where they will go with this, presumably a sequel and whether Joaquin will face-off with Batman."

Well mostly, I mean commenting is unavoidable in a hall. But yeah. At one point my jaw was literally hanging open for a fairly long period. I was entirely aware of it but was compelled to keep it open, because I couldn't shut it willingly.That's not an everyday experience, especially being desensitized by the constant consumption of media. And as a Joker fan I thought I knew him, that I'd seen it all. That his mind was as familiar as a well read book. I don't mean he's predictable, after all the Joker is well known for upsetting expectations. Rather, certain actions fit the Joker psychologically. So when he pulls one of his characteristic moves you're like, ah yes, a classic Joker. But the Joker had to, well, pull a Joker on us all. Because I saw none of that coming. There were these moments where I'd stare at the screen saying to myself, did I see what I just saw? What did I just see?At the end of the movie I was left feeling simultaneously discombobulated and yet Sublime. I can't explain it, what it is or why it is, but I feel amazed at seeing something amazing. Usually I'm articulate enough to come up with some reason as to why something made me feel a certain way. In this case I've got nothing. I think I need to see the film again just to figure out my exact opinions. Or maybe I won't have an exact opinion. Maybe that is the point of the movie, that not everything can be labeled neatly. That sometimes you can only enjoy the chaos.Rarely there are these gems of comic book movies that transcend the norms. That offer a unique and transcendental experience. Logan and Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse are one of those few and Joker has joined their ranks. Congrats to DC.Update: I totally recommend watching this movie alongside Inception. I feel like these films speak to each other."

Not one good thing happens to the protagonist. Misery upon misery upon misery.So many problems with the plot. First of all - since when did social workers dispense medication? Why does Arthur ask his social worker for an increase in the dose of his medication? When she says she's losing her job, he asks where will he get his medication from. Er.... how about seeing your psychiatrist?And the writing is so predictable - so obvious that he was having fantasies about the Murray Franklin show. More obvious delusions regarding the neighbour "girlfriend". Very obvious he was going to murder Murray on the chat show. As for the writing - Who the hell walks into a hospital, asks to see some medical notes and is told yes you can see them. Oh no sorry you can't. And since when did medical notes have newspaper cuttings stuck in them?And why would a single woman with mental health problems be allowed to adopt a child?So many holes to pick in this ludicrous plot.So what's the point of this film? To celebrate the misery of mental illness?And regarding the subject of mental illness, I felt this was an incredibly shallow depiction. Man gets mugged, man loses his job, man turns into killer. No effort whatsoever to try and understand the complex issues of depression.The film was just dreadful. Shallow. Predictable. Badly written. Annoying.Can you tell I hated it?"

4,7-Oct-19,HRH2001,1,3,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"Joker is, as a critique of the government's handling of mental health and the subsequent social stigma surrounding it, a bonafide masterpiece.","I was originally sceptical of the Festival hype surrounding Joker. I was absolutely and unequivocally blown away. Following actors like Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger, the expectations were high for Joaquin Phoenix - he overachieved. Phoenix's Joker is both similar and different to that of Nolan's The Dark Knight, however it is through the differences that the story really comes to fruition. While the two can be compared in terms of their physical appearance (worn-away makeup, slicked-back green hair), they are, obviously, distinctively separated in terms of their genres, leading Phoenix's portrayal to be one of an extreme introspection, with more revealed, perhaps, in what is not said, but what is shown by the character. Robert De Niro fits seamlessly into Phillips' film as Murray Franklin, embodying the Talk Show Host that America has been familiar with now for what seems like eons. Drawing on the likes of Scorsese's King of Comedy and Taxi Driver, Marty's influence on this film is undeniable. The parallels that can be drawn between Travis Bickle and Arthur Fleck are indisputable, and similarly portray the notion that societal isolation can irreparably damage its victims. This film is unquestionably worthy of its R rating, with scenes evoking extreme violence. However, these scenes serve as essential for the characterisation of Fleck, and are demonstrative of his gradual decay into madness. Those who have seen the film and consider it boring are, perhaps, more used to being overstimulated by the likes of the Marvel movies, in which special effects and CGI dominate over the true narrative. This character study had a budget of 50 million, and, despite the lack of overt effects, is stunning in design. One scene that is brought to mind is before Fleck's entrance onto the Murray Franklin Show, behind the curtain, where Phoenix's unnerving dancing is accompanied by the flawless score of Hildur Guðnadóttir, which is undeniably haunting and serves in itself as a piece of art. While the film itself may not win the Oscar due to the Academy's bias against movies involving comic-book characters (except when there is political motivation), Phoenix, without question is deserving of his first Best Actor, which is surprising after his once-in-a-generation type performances in The Master, Her, and Walk the Line. His performance in this film is indubitably his chef d'oeuvre, and it would be a great tragedy if he lost. Or would it be a comedy?"

SKL. I am no expert in movies reviews"Joker" the movie was awesome! True what they about it, being dark, being morbid and being brutal. But it is suppose to be dark, morbid and brutal because this is not a hero's movie, it is a villain's movie. But with such theme, I have seen a clearer picture of the importance of the significance of mental health, the value of a society and the worth of one self.If they say heroes are made, villains too are bred. It just need two of the most important ingredients - society and oneself. Arthur aka Joker has conflicts already with what surrounds him and most especially with himself. He trying to fight his demons. Trying so hard but in the end ate him all up. He was trying to reach out help from society. He wanted to be understood, accepted and loved for who he was with all his imperfections but society showed its cruelty upon him that allowed his demons get the best the him. And allowed him to fight against society itself. The movie has showed that the need to belong and to be loved has a price to pay and the payment is oneself - losing oneself in the process.Society is ruthless in its own way. I know I always say, you always have a choice whether to allow society get the best of you or allow yourself to control who your are. But if this relentless environment wont stop and continue to haunt you and conditions you, i cannot blame the individual to become who he wish he'd not become. Society breeds its own demons.Never underestimate the power of the mind and the power of society for it can make or break in ways you can't imagine.That is why please, let us learn to accept and start understand each other. We all have predicaments in life, but people right now don't need your judgements and fanciful opinions about how to live life. What most people need right is unconditional positive regard on who they are. And may we bring back humanity in humans by doing so.Take care of your peace of mind. Talk to professional like teachers, professors, counselors, psychologist, social workers, etc. But if not this kind of individual, go to persons you trust, to person that understands you and accepts you. Mental health issues are not made to be battled alone. Because we always need someone at the end of the day to help us be on our feet. So please society give these professionals what they deserve.Society makes is own demons but surely it can undo it as well.And lastly, love yourself despite of everything because whatever happens it will always be about you.The Joker movie is dark and powerful but you have to see that behind that dark theme, has a formidable meaning."

4,8-Dec-19,intothesanctum,0,1,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"Sanctum Review","Joker was directed by Todd Philips and stars Joaquin Phoenix, Robert De Niro and Zazie Beetz, and is the first film in DC's Black series of films. I wasn't entirely sold on the concept when I first heard of a Joker origin film sans Batman; to have your lead be a merciless, murderous villain, without any equivalent opposition is a rough narrative prospect. You'd naturally want the audience to have sympathy for this guy, but how do you accomplish that when he's just killing with nihilistic fervour? You'd have to shift the tone, and struggle for the lead in just the right way if you wanted it to work.After seeing the first full trailer, I knew they had quite possibly nailed it. And they sure as hell did. The tone, pacing and choice of the narrative were perfect. I couldn't imagine a better Joker origin film if I tried, and a lot of that has to do with originality. I'm a huge Joker fan, I've seen so many version of the character on screen and on the page, and this one is special because it stands out, and while that may put some fans off, I loved it. Phoenix is mesmerizing. His portrayal is his own, and the subtle nuance he brings to the character is layered and not easily noticeable to the untrained eye; he has a variety of laughs that all serve a function at hand, and his characterization is a dualistic balance of isolationist resentment, and mimicry. Mimicry is a big part of this character, and it blends into his laughter seamlessly. He is in nearly every shot in this film, and he is a tremendous presence as a result.The supporting cast is excellent all around, De Niro and Beetz are great whenever on screen and their characters were functionally well-placed within the narrative in spite of not having a tremendous amount of screen time The score and soundtrack were so well crafted, and I loved the string compositions. The cinematography is top-notch, I have a truckload of favourite shots from this film. Lots of dark gritty shots, but also many with popping, bright colours.This is most definitely a film that begs multiple viewings as well as discourse. It's a work of art that deserves all the praise it has received, as well as being the highest-grossing R-rated film of all-time. I loved it, and I cannot wait to rewatch it. If you're a fan and haven't seen it, and are on the fence - give it a chance. You might not hate it.Another Perspective By Phantom KnightI discuss the premise of the movie in my short review which some may construe as containing spoilers.If you have not seen the movie I would suggest that you DO NOT GO ANY FURTHER.I for one was definitely taken in by the media hype surrounding Joker and to be totally honest, many times when there is a big comic book release concerning iconic characters I am always ready and waiting.I suppose the question I should answer is did I enjoy joker?Yes & no is my answer. To begin with, Joker hits many many high points. The acting is superb, the music is top-notch and is a real scene setter. The cinematography is also excellent with many shots taking place that really pop and without a doubt will inevitably become famous scenes over the years after its release.The character arc of Arthur Fleck descending into the abyss that is madness is a haunting one and for me is directed in a superb way. In many respects, I fully expected to sympathize with Arthur much like many other films of this type. You expect to identify with the villain and gradually see their flawed & evil persona overtake them.In some aspects and in many ways throughout most of the movie I could see that arc transpire but leaving out one key element. I didn't really sympathize with Arthur by the movie's end. A key element to sympathy for any villain is that you see the suffering that they have endured but continue to endure. To me, Arthur suffered but became his true self by the end of the movie. He was somewhat born again, washed away were all of the heinous acts committed against him, he was a new person, perhaps the person he was forced into becoming. My point is he was not a victim at the end, far from it in fact. He had transformed from the victim to the victimiser. He took control of the horrible hand he was dealt in life, he was standing on his own two feet, albeit in an insane and homicidal way.Joker is certainly not a feel-good movie, of that I am certain. I left the cinema almost unsure of how I felt as I certainly didn't feel warm & fuzzy. Normally I travel to the cinema expecting to be entertained, feeling good as I leave the theatre. This was a different cinema experience and I left feeling down and dare say it a little depressed. It is a bleak movie and could easily have survived without the batman/joker paradigm. I fear that a movie with the DC back story definitely helped pull in the punters for which would have otherwise been a tough sell if you remove the iconic star name of the Joker.With that said the Joker certainly made me think about how I felt, I had to decode in my own mind my feelings as they weren't abundantly clear to me at the end of the movie. After spending some time thinking about Joker, I can say, at least from my perspective, the movie is about the ways in which neglect, abuse, harassment, bullying and psychosis can affect the human condition. In today's society, many people commit heinous crimes but not a great deal is ever made of the reasons as to why this has occurred. This movie, in my opinion, deals with those ideas and shows what could happen when someone is marginalized to a huge degree throughout their life.Overall, I can't really recommend this movie in the traditional sense. It definitely comes with a disclaimer from me. If you like movies that are based in psychology and show aspects of a person's slow demise into madness then you will get a lot out of this movie. If you are expecting this to be a typical DC movie where the Joker takes down a few scores, coupled with a few laughs along the way then it's not for you.Phantom Knight"

4,22-Jan-20,brodywitta,0,0,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"Movie Review","Imagine finding yourself abandoned by society, trapped alone by yourself. People laugh at the only way to express yourself, through stand up comedy, and not because it's funny, but because you're weird. You're mother lied to you about who your father is, the doctors cut off your medication for mental health, and you get jumped on the streets. You slowly start to descend into madness. Welcome to Todd Phillips "Joker". A brilliant spectacle of the human mind and a transformation of a comic book character to a big screen villain.When Joker had first gotten into theaters, it had its critics. The media constantly bashing the movie complaining about how it glorifies killing people as a way to take out frustration, forgetting that this is The Joker we are talking about here, not some made up anti hero. The Joker as a character has been around for decades in DC movies as the viewer gets to see him take on Batman. However it's the first time we get a stand alone take on the "Why" of the character. Why is he the way he is? Why does he loathe the Wayne's? What is his real name? Questions that have been asked forever but are now finally answered. Joker finally has a name, Arthur Fleck. Though this movie is a stand alone movie, not connected to any previous Batman's or DC movies, it is hard to picture anyone else other than Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker. The acting of Phoenix is deserving of all praise. He can go from a mentally ill family man taking care of his mother to a dancing psychopath shooting innocent talk show hosts. But out of all the phenomenal acting in the film, one scene stands out the most. That is his confrontation with Murray Franklin. He goes on a rant to Murray and finally admits to killing 3 young men. But he gives his reasons. Society treats him like crap, he is abandoned, and he is lied too. He fatally shoots Murray and is arrested. The film ends with Arthur thinking of a joke in a mental hospital. One nurse asks him what it is and he replies with, "you wouldn't get it". The film ends with Arthur running out of the hospital with blood on his feet, looking for freedom. The film overall is a beautiful and brilliant spectacle of the origins of the character of The Joker. The cinematography throughout the whole film is breathtaking and gives of a 70's, rustic filter type feel. Many components of the film are reminiscent of Taxi Driver and King of Comedy.The film is a must see and easily an instant classic and Phoenix's take on The Joker will not be beaten for a while. (Unless they do a sequel).With regards to the media's concern about the film creating a motive for people like Arthur Fleck in the real world, that's not how it's going to play out. Everybody understands what this movie is, and who it's about because the character has exited for over 60 years now. If anything, it makes people understand what people with mental illnesses have to go through, and why they should take their medicine and be looked after. It also teaches the audience not to abandon certain people because of the way they look. Anyways, the media couldn't stop Joker (it made over a billion) and you shouldn't let the media stop you from watching it. It is one of the few greats in front of our eyes and I could watch it 10x over."

4,14-Jan-20,horrorgasm,456,778,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"Yikes. THIS is people's "best movie ever"?","The recurring themes of so many of the 10 star reviews here should tell you a lot about this movie and its audience. If you can't get through a movie review without tossing in one or more claims that "THIS movie is so much better and smarter than YOUR superhero movie" (or even basing your entire review around this premise), then I hate to break it to you, but kid, you're nowhere near as intelligent and grown up as you think you are. This "my comic publisher is better than yours" BS should have been left behind on your grade school playground, it has absolutely no relevance to the quality of this movie, and your opinion of this movie should be considered highly suspect if you're in this group.I gotta say, if this movie was also your idea of the most perfect film ever made, you really need to get out more. Look, I get it. If you live in a safe little box where all you watch are superhero movies and mainstream blockbusters then I understand how exposure to themes like this for the first time would seem new and exciting to you, and I think we can all agree that this is probably the best DC Comics related movie in the last decade or so (though that's not a high bar to meet) and of course Joaquin Phoenix is a very talented actor, but stop and take a step back and look at this thing.Joker does indeed present a theme that is of importance to our society, that of the neglect and demonizing of the mentally ill to a degree that sometimes creates monsters which everyone around them should have seen coming a mile away if they hadn't been too busy looking away to avoid feeling uncomfortable. Unfortunately, reminding us all of the fact that this situation still exists is all this movie really has to say. It dances around important subjects like "HEY KIDS, CLASS INEQUALITY!", but then never offers any actual insight into them, usually because it's too busy making forced Batman references or dropping cringey little edgy moments like the "Don't smile" sign scene which seem to have been designed solely to have something for Hot Topic to print a new t-shirt of. Between that and every single plot twist being telegraphed so very far in advance because a lot of us have seen all these exact same twists so very many times before, I just wasn't impressed.Perhaps if this had been an actual stand-alone movie of its own instead of being shackled by its completely unnecessary ties to the Batman universe it could have done something more interesting with its themes. Don't get me wrong, I don't have any problem with superhero movies, but it just feels so gratuitous here, as if someone came up with this idea, pitched it to an executive, and was told "sounds great, but can you make it a Batman movie somehow?", and I'm sorry, but I'm just not into a movie trying to tell me a half-hearted, yet dead-serious speech about mental illness in modern society while simultaneously constantly reminding me that it's technically a superhero movie because $$$"

It's not a terrible film, but it's not a great (or even a really good one) either. The technical aspects are great. The score and cinematography are really good. Many individual scenes are also good. But as a whole, it just feels unnecessary. Not just that, but tone deaf as well. What it's trying to say about mental illness is problematic. Why? Because it's not really sure what it's trying to say or if it's even trying to say anything about it at all. Instead, it was added in there because, well, it's easy right? Joaquin Phoenix really does excel in many scenes of the film, but I'm not sure I would want him winning an Oscar for this. Overall, it's also just not that interesting. It's kind of... boring at times. And for a Joker film to be boring? That's a crucial offense.

This movie gives him a plausible, wildly dark and often sad origin story. This would not be the same movie without Phoenix's eccentric performance. He made it disturbing and believable. If he wins the Oscar for lead actor, it will be the second time someone won an Oscar for being the Joker (the other being Heath Ledger in 2009).The story may hit a deep note with many people who've felt disenfranchised, alienated or ignored by society or their families. For 2 hours, I felt drawn into the world and crazed reality of the main character, Arthur Fleck (aka Joker). For that - I have to say it was a compelling watch."

Regardless of my mixed feelings, I think it's the best film about the psychological effect of violence as pop art since Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange.Vigorously directed by Todd Phillips, who also co-wrote the unique if uneven screenplay with Scott Silver, and beautifully shot by Lawrence Sher, Joker traces the history of the popular DC Comics villain and Batman's arch enemy in totally original terms.

Phillips' tackling of certain political and social issues will spark conversations in groups full of people smarter than myself, but I understood the messages that were coming across. But Joaquin Phoenix is one of the biggest draws of the film with such a praiseworthy performance. I don't really care for the Oscars and award shows anymore, but Phoenix deserves the accolades coming his way for such a masterful and haunting performance.One thing that I must point out, is that it's unfair to compare Phoenix to Heath Ledger's performance in The Dark Knight. They may play the character with the same name, but these are two drastically different portrayals in both performance and script and it's unjust to compare. Just worship the fact that we were given two immense performances from two different actors."

The acting is good but nowhere near perfection. The camera work is good but shows nothing new, the same goes to everything else.It's ok at best so I'd give it a 4-5 but since everyone treats it as a masterpiece, so will I. Compared to Pulp Fiction, Eraserhead, The Audition, Dances with Wolves, Lone Wolf and Cub, The Dark Knight, Alien etc it's a shaky 2 at best...sorryIf you break it down it's a crazy guy dancing and making funny faces while the message is slapping you in the face.Nothing artsy about this piece of mainstream cinema."

Sign in to vote.,"Joker isn't just an awesome comic book movie, it's an awesome movie, period.","Featuring a riveting, fully realized, and Oscar-worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix, Joker would work just as well as an engrossing character study without any of its DC Comics trappings; that it just so happens to be a brilliant Batman-universe movie is icing on the Batfan cake. You will likely leave Joker feeling like I did: unsettled and ready to debate the film for years to come.Clearly drawing its spirit and style from classic '70s and '80s films like Taxi Driver, The King of Comedy, A Clockwork Orange, and Dog Day Afternoon, director Todd Phillips' Joker presents a Gotham City that is unmistakably a stand-in for the hellish New York City of the era. It was a time when rampant crime, corruption, economic crises, and social ills saw it dubbed "Fear City."This Gotham is a place of grimy despair, extreme wealth disparity, and festering lawlessness, teetering on the brink of collapse. While this realistic depiction makes a place that's typically fantastical seem familiar, it's not just the recognizable setting that gives Joker its hyper-realism; it's what it's allegorically about that makes the movie so believable, timely, and worth talking about long after the credits roll. Joker is a period piece but it is undeniably about our own troubled, relentlessly violent time.Joker's setting (roughly 1981) not only allows the film to be a comic book version of classic Martin Scorsese or Sidney Lumet films, it also strips away the technology that nowadays would help catch such a madman sooner rather than later. This is a time when people smoked everywhere (including hospitals), security cameras and metal detectors weren't ubiquitous, and no one wore seat belts while driving. Times were bad but they could get even worse. Joker the character acts as the symbolic match to that waiting dynamite.Unnervingly played by Joaquin Phoenix, the mentally ill Arthur Fleck is a struggling, overlooked schlepp trapped on the margins of society. Arthur is a man who has never had a good break or happy day in his life. The less said about how and why Arthur embraces the Joker persona and finds his liberation and joyful empowerment the better - this is a film meant to be experienced with an open mind and sans spoilers - but suffice it to say this Joker is the end result of a society far too comfortable with its casual cruelties and lack of empathy. We create the monsters we deserve.Joker is an indictment of a society's collective disregard for the well-being of its citizens rather than necessarily critiquing any one type of individual or class. As much as you sympathize with their plight, Gotham's downtrodden can be as callous and vicious as the rich and powerful. Arthur is at one point or another injured emotionally or physically by individuals at every level, as well as by the institutions they populate. If Taxi Driver's Travis Bickle called himself "God's lonely man" then Arthur Fleck is certainly Gotham's lonely man. Arthur is ultimately seeking human connection, something he tragically won't find until he puts on a happy face and violently exposes the city's own hypocrisies and inhumanity.Joker the film may ask viewers to empathize with its central protagonist but it doesn't ask us to forgive him for his increasingly evil choices. As many real-world parallels and inspirations can be uncomfortably drawn from Arthur's descent into violent madness, the film still knows he's deranged and not to be romanticized - merely understood.The Many Origin Stories of the JokerThe key to that careful calibration is not only Todd Phillips' sharp direction and clear vision but also Joaquin Phoenix's indelible performance. Arthur's uncontrollable laughter looks as though it physically pains him; his body is rail-thin and battered, his misery is etched on his deeply creased face. He looks healthier and livelier -- dare I say happier -- as he transforms into Joker than he ever does as Arthur. Phoenix captures all these tiny nuances in Arthur and his interactions with others that reveal so much about this disturbed individual's inner life.The camerawork is often claustrophobically tight on Phoenix, who's in nearly every scene, all of which adds to the film never making me feel like I was anywhere but in Arthur's tortured headspace. As solid as Robert De Niro, Zazie Beetz and Frances Conroy are in their small roles here, this is Phoenix's film and he delivers a tour de force.Considering the comic book Joker infamously once said he preferred his origin to be multiple choice, this movie wisely embraces the ambiguity of its title character, despite this seemingly being an origin story. Arthur's increasingly unstable mental state is reflected in the film as things grow progressively more dreamlike -- okay, nightmarish -- and violent in the homestretch.Phillips (along with co-screenwriter Scott Silver) designed a film that demands multiple viewings; one of Joker's strengths is that anyone will be able to argue their side about what was real and what was imagined, and no one will be able to say another's read of it is inaccurate. For a movie about one of fiction's most unreliable narrators, we should expect nothing less.VerdictJoker isn't just an awesome comic book movie, it's an awesome movie, period. It offers no easy answers to the unsettling questions it raises about a cruel society in decline. Joaquin Phoenix's fully committed performance and Todd Phillips' masterful albeit loose reinvention of the DC source material make Joker a film that should leave comic book fans and non-fans alike disturbed and moved in all the right ways."

Sign in to vote.,"The Greatest Comic-Book Supervillain Gets The Greatest Supervillain Origin Story","Put on a happy face and smile coz with Joker, the greatest comic-book supervillain at last gets his very own origin story, and it is exactly how it must be: Dark, bleak, deranged, manic, wretched & downright nihilistic. Also, with no good to counter the evil this time around, it is a full-on descent into madness & hysteria that viewers are either gonna detest or embrace wholeheartedly.Co-written & directed by Todd Phillips, this standalone take on the origins of the iconic arch nemesis attempts to create his psychological profile by painting a grisly portrait of an unstable mind that's hanging by a thread on the edge of insanity until he finally snaps. Discarding the existing blueprint of its genre, this reincarnation of Joker offers a low-budget, grounded treatment but with hugely rewarding dividends.Though Phillips' direction could dig into Joker's unhinged persona to only a certain extent, Joaquin Phoenix's chilling rendition of the eponymous psychopath bridges the gap and overcomes the few nitpicks with thrilling intensity, for he is gripping & breathtaking throughout. Other vital inputs come from the story's nihilistic tone & treatment, its grim atmosphere, sudden brutal violence, and Hildur Guðnadóttir's haunting score.Scarier than most horror films of today, Joker bestows the notorious madman with an origin story that's as plausible as it is cold & callous, and makes for an insanely riveting character study that works even if one strips the premise off its comic book roots. Driven by Joaquin Phoenix's powerful, unsettling & memorable performance, this cautionary tale of a psychotic who in search for identity mistakenly becomes a symbol is arguably the best film of the year."

Sign in to vote.,"eerily effective with polarizing content","In the early 1980s Gotham City has deteriorated into an incendiary cesspool of crime and apathy where the rich and powerful have cast aside lower-class residents like Arthur Fleck, a party clown who's been disregarded his entire life. In spite of this he aspires to make it as a stand-up comedian, but his troubled history and mental erosion have begun to strip away what remains of his sanity. If you're looking to bring a well-known comic book character to the big screen in a way that's never been done before then look no further: this relentlessly dark and morbid story from Todd Phillips (yes, same one from The Hangover) is a psychologically twisted and unnerving character study of a frightening individual's downward spiral and just how far he'll go to make a name for himself. Intense, riveting, allegorical but equally audacious, chaotic and off-putting with a sluggish first half, how much actual enjoyment is derived from watching it is in the eye of the beholder, but there's no denying the work of Phoenix (with shades of Christian Bale) who dominates the screen with his unflinching portrait of the damaged protagonist...not for the faint of heart. **½"

4,10-Oct-19,Heisenberg999,10,19,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"Darkest and grittiest film of the year","From the director of "The Hangover" trilogy comes a dark and gritty version of Joker's origin story. His version of the Joker seems to be heavily inspired by Martin Scorsese's "The King of Comedy" with a touch of "Taxi Driver". On top of that, there are some attempts of commentary about society and how crooked it is. When you mix all those things up, you get a film that's going to divide everyone's opinions.Let's begin with the good stuff first. Easily, the best part of the film was a performance by Joaquin Phoenix. He carried this film completely and he gave one of the better performances of his career (nothing is going to beat his performance in "The Master"). He proved once again why he's one of the best actors working today. If someone else was in his place, there's no way this film would've worked. His mannerisms, facial expressions (especially how he showed so many different emotions through laughs and eye expressions at the same time), his physicality and his vulnerability were incredible. If this film received a bit better reviews he would definitely be the main contender for that Oscar. Furthermore, the next aspect with which I was blown away was the score. I would even say that the score was a more effective way of showing emotions than the script. Because of the score at every moment, you knew how you were supposed to feel regarding what's happening on the screen, and that was achieved in a way that wasn't forceful. If you listen carefully to the score, you can even distinguish what scenes happened in reality and which were just in his imagination. Those two aspects of the film were outstanding and they carried the film noticeably. The color palette really nicely supported the script. Through the colors in the film, you could've seen in what mood the main character was and how he felt about what was happening around him. Colors helped to immerse the audience into that time period (I would say the film happened in 1981 because the movie theatre was showing the film "Blow Out" which came out in that year), but that wouldn't work without production design which was on the point.The cinematography was decent. Although the director's vision wasn't groundbreaking I generally enjoyed most of the camera choices.Let's get into some aspects that weren't so good. The script. It's one of the weakest parts of the film. You get a feeling the film wanted to say a lot, but unfortunately, it ended up saying almost nothing. There were a lot of attempts to give some social commentary, but for me personally, that fell flat because there wasn't any explanation of why is everything how it is. Joker as a character for the huge part of the film was complaining about how society is bad and how everyone is mean, but there wasn't any reason given why is the world like that, beyond poverty and poor people suck and rich people are corrupted and evil. Regarding that specific aspect, I felt like the director wanted to say a lot, but it just ended up being shallow and on the nose. The film was beating you over the head of how everything is bad. I would've appreciated concluding by myself that the world is crooked, but instead, I was just told what the situation was, without any room for my own interpretations. And that explained situation wasn't backed up with any other pieces of information. This time, tell don't show approach didn't work out. Furthermore, speaking of the script, all characters except Joker were unbelievable and underwritten. Zazie Beetz was completely unutilized and the relationship between her character and the Joker was underdeveloped. The film was supposed to make you believe in their relationship, but it didn't and because of it the film suffered at the later stages of its runtime. I understood what did film tried to achieve with their relationship, but that wasn't realized very well. That sentence could've been used for many aspects of this film. Robert De Niro as an older version of Rupert Pupkin had a ton of fun in this film, one of the better De Niro's performances since "Casino". They could've done more with his character, but at least it seemed like he had fun with this project. So, Joker is basically the only character that was decently written, but the thing is, the director didn't make a clear choice if we were supposed to feel for him or we were supposed to hate him because of his actions. Don't get me wrong, he isn't a good person, but the film way too many times tried to make the audience sympathize with him. I don't know if that was intentional or not, but at the times it felt way too forceful.In the end, looking at the whole picture, this is a good film but isn't anything spectacular. At the same time, I would say the film was overblown with praises of how good it was, and yet at the same time, it was unfairly criticized because of some aspects in the film (e.g. the usage of violence)."

This movie is not for marvel fans who laughs the predictable childish jokes of marvel movies. the movie has lots of jokes from Joker but each of them gives you a thought instead of laugh. the laugh of Joker gave me mixed feelings each time i heard he didnt copy what Heath did but he created brilliant style of his own. this story line still caries a lot of things from the comic books which i can not spoil here.Joaquin played an excellent character here. You literally see his changes and craziness in his eyes through out the movie. How can he succeed that transform is beyond my understanding.Directing also deserves an Oscar just because Todd made a great work to show us how once poor man becomes a mass murdering killer. The story-line was fluid with some twists which made even more better.And last thing that people are wondering! Who is better Joker?Joaquin or Heath?My opinion that would not be a correct comparison. Joaquin portrayed a normal man who became Joker, while Heath was already playing an established character Joker. Even though both played the same character, Joker has transformation and character thorough out his time. In my humble opinion Joaquin also deserved Oscar.But both of them did a fantastic job for playing such a hard character.I am planning to see it again."

If you like good cinema you will like this."Joker" stands as one of the most left wing films I have ever seen that persuasively validates left wing theory, which is funny because they are the ones attacking it without having seen it! Cancel culture is stupid isn't it?I felt the crushing weight and pressure of a cold society that did not care about the working class and that favored the elite. I saw a lonely human being kicked until he decided enough was enough and that resistance was not only the best way, but the only way forward.I never felt more revved up to "fight the power" and give the middle finger to a corrupt system than after seeing the Joker!The movie doesn't glorify shootings or vigilante justice so much as it makes it clear that if you take away options for people and treat them like they don't matter and don't exist then rebellion and riots WILL HAPPEN. It isn't so much a threat as an inevitability. People need to feel like the game isn't rigged against them to want to play.The way to fix society is to reach out to others more, to be more kind, and to fix the broken corrupt system that lacks humanity and only cares about money.The Joker is a hero for those who society deems garbage and worthless. In the movie there is a protester holding a sign that symbolizes modern-day society and it's connection to this movie perfectly: We are all clowns."

4,7-Oct-19,jdesando,3,9,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"Oscar potential for actor and movie.",""I used to think that my life was a tragedy, but now I realize, it's a comedy." Arthur Fleck aka Joker (Joaquin Phoenix)"Joker" has many faces, the two most prominent are tragedy and comedy. The tragedy is played amid murders and childhood abuse. The comedy comes intermittently, mostly as an accompaniment to the tragedy. Both modes amply identify Arthur Fleck, aka Joker, as a misfit and psycho, for whom only murder can make him feel alive.With the exception of Travis Bickle from Taxi Driver, no better psychological study has come by than with Joaquin Phoenix as the troubled enemy of Batman. He may win the best-acting Oscar unless a more riveting anti-hero emerges before the end of the year.Besides Taxi Driver, another Scorsese influence shows Robert De Niro as Murray Franklin, a talk show host, who befriends Joker, a failed stand-up comedian. As in The King of Comedy, where De Niro's Rupert Pupkin pursues comedian Jerry Lewis, Joker "befriends" De Niro as talk-show host. Both films are aces at showing a character on the fringe of society, in Joker's case a nut job from neglect as an orphan, who kills Bruce Wayne's parents and his own mother.To see Arthur, evolve into Joker is to watch a master actor take a nerdy a-social kid to a serial killer, a fitting antagonist for Bruce Wayne, who saw Arthur murder his parents.Beyond the physical mutation of losing a Christian Bale-like fifty pounds, Phoenix consistently uses tics and laughs to emphasize how out of the center he is. The laughing condition, occurring randomly, is an apt metaphor for his inability to tell a joke or to fit normally in society. "I just don't want to feel so bad anymore," Arthur whispers. It's hard to imagine he could ever feel well given he takes five different medications.As Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger showed, the joker character holds multitudes within his persona, enough for more than two hours of any film. Todd Philips directs an origin story about a psychopathic murderer who devolves along with the society he hates:"Is it just me, or is it getting crazier out there?" ArthurDo see one of the best performances of a male actor this year, but don't take the kids."

Sign in to vote.,"The role that finally won the Oscar for Joaquin Phoenix.","With sections of New York and New Jersey standing in for Gotham City this movie depicts the origin story of The Joker. Joaquin Phoenix is Arthur Fleck, still living in a small apartment with his mother, working menial jobs he can get with the ambition to be a successful stand up comic. But life often deals us hard knocks for no reason at all and Arthur, with his own mental illness driving him, has increasing difficulty handling them. It all comes to a head when on the subway, dressed in his clown suit after a job, when he gets accosted by three Wall Street types.The thing about the actor Phoenix, he always puts himself out there totally, he always has. He is just perfect here, his demeanor, his body language, his facial expressions, even the awkward way he runs. He deserves his Best Actor Oscar.This is set at the time when Bruce Wayne was a young boy, the time that he witnessed his parents being killed in the alley after a theater performance. There is a brief encounter at the gates of the Wayne home, of the eventual Batman and the eventual Joker.I really didn't think I'd like this movie but it really is a fine one, even though fiction of course it shows how mental illness greatly influences the trajectory of one's life. It was also fun to see Robert De Niro as late night show host Murray Franklin, patterned after the old Johnny Carson show, even with a trumpeter as the band leader.I watched it at home on BluRay from my public library, my wife skipped. The disc has a number of worthwhile "extras.""

The Wayne/Batman connections are weighty and dramatic enough not to induce eye-rolling. Cinematographer Lawrence Sher delivers the atmospheric grit of the late 70s into an early 1980s set Joker.The psychological aspect is reminiscent of American Psycho with a play on what is real and what is not. Its intriguing throughout watching Fleck's metamorphosis into something quite edgy and creepy during the briskly paced running time.Phillips expertly injects violence that is hard hitting, that emulates the simmering and brutal kills of The Godfather, Goodfellas and the like with a tragic character and dark comedy at its core.It's a must see, if anything, it's arguably too well made to be a comic book movie."

Sign in to vote.,"One of the best movies of the past few years","Some of the "cinematic masterpiece!" raves and reviews may be overhyping it a bit, but "Joker" really is, in my opinion, one of the best movies made in recent years.While I did enjoy the Batman movies of the late 80's and early 90's (and the Dark Knight), I'm really not much of a fan of modern superhero movies and tend to avoid them. The majority of them honestly just come off to me as a bunch of corporate, focus-grouped nonsense and copious amounts of CGI weaved together to appeal to the widest possible audience. When I heard "Joker" was less superhero and more reality based, I figured I'd give it a shot. I'm very glad I did.In terms of "Batman" lore, the little that's involved in the storyline is both interesting and so basic that even non-fans will follow it. I think at this point it's common knowledge in American culture who Bruce Wayne is and the basics of his origin story.Leaving aside the lore, as a stand alone story it's absolutely brilliant. It follows the path of a man already teetering on the edge as he slowly descends into complete madness. It doesn't just begin with an over the top, villainous caricature. This is just some guy, living with mental illness, in poverty with his mother.There's some heavy social commentary (particularly about poverty and mental illness), but that too is done brilliantly, intelligently and effectively. It's not the superficial nonsense of spoon-feeding you buzzwords and talking points about whatever political trends are popular on social media this month. It's not the sacrificing of quality storytelling in favor of disingenuous virtue signaling and beating the viewer over the head with it to make sure it appeals to the lowest common denominator. It's just there. The writers effectively put it in the background throughout the entire movie, arguably getting some pretty strong messages across while barely even acknowledging it openly.This isn't just a movie that makes you feel, it's one that makes you think. It doesn't treat morality as black or white and it doesn't lecture. Just as in life, there are no real purely "good" or "bad" people. Everyone is somewhere on the grey spectrum. It forces you to maybe not sympathize, but empathize with characters who are, let's just say extremely flawed. You may not agree with what they do, you may find it heinous, but you understand how and even why they got to that point.There are a few areas of the plot that are left up to the interpretation of the viewer, but it's not done in a pretentious or obnoxious way that leaves you walking away unsatisfied. It's one of those movies that can leave you thinking about it and analyzing it for days after.It's dark, it's gritty, it's often times uncomfortable. It's probably one of the few movies of the past few years that could realistically be classified as art."

Sign in to vote.,"joker","Joker (2019, Todd Phillips)After the DC comics connected universe films came in under expectations (although still profitable), DC started planning out some stand alone films and Todd Phillips (Old School, The Hangover) approached them about doing a Joker film in a gritty style akin to The King of Comedy and Taxi Driver. With the film requiring a much lower budget than the usual superhero blockbusters it was green-lit.The talk for the subsequent years of production of it being something we have not seen in the realm of comic book movies before have proved correct, as we have a character study/ drama with this film. In that respect it is a refreshing change. The film is indeed a gritty feeling serious drama with a great central performance from Joaquin Phoenix (Her) that raises the film to another level.As far as the direction goes, the film looks good but my main issue is just how much it apes the two Scorsese films it is inspired by. Taking that tone is one thing but not only does this have similar story moments (also forgivable) but has shots/ scenes that feel duplicated. It will take film buffs out of the movie as they spot these pretty regularly throughout. So depending on how much the shameless aping of King of Comedy and especially Taxi Driver will bother you may effect your score. It bothered me a fair amount at times but I am sure it will bother others more than me and many less.That aside it is a good character study with a memorable lead performance and a welcome change to the mainstream box office. As far as the controversy over subject matter, the people who want to be outraged by things will find things in it to be outraged about but in the end it's just a movie and also it doesn't appear to endorse things has just present a fairly believable story.7.5/10"

This prepared me for the story, and more so, the messaged conveyed.Ultimately this piece of cinema tellsthe audience of the harmful effect that comes from neglecting, bullying, and abusing. All while suggesting empathy and true friendship to all people regardless of mental health. The beauty of this film is that it produces conversation on how to be better and what we can do to be better, not just individually but collectively, as a society.Finally it would be remiss of me not to mention the work put into this film, namely Todd Philips and Joaquin Phoenix. From direction to the edit, every process expelled masterclass for the film. Reminding me of a Scorsese picture, this films production was astounding. Of all these operations, the soundtrack blew me away, making each moment feel exactly how the director wanted. Joaquin's performance was unnerving and dedicated, Todd's direction was twisted and beautiful.Joker is not a light-hearted film, there is depth and discomfort. A story to produce change and show the importance of empathy. A masterpiece in the art of cinematography."

As much as I enjoy the Marvel universe, in my personal opinion none of those actors can pull off a performance like Joaquin in Joker.This movie proves that you don't need all the syfy and special effects to make a movie great, it has solid acting by a brilliant actor.Doesn't look like he would do another one but it would be awesome if he did.I love Phoenix and Deniro's chemistry together.Such a great film, one that definitely deserves to receive several nominations and accolades."

The acting and the actual scene shots where so artistic and well delivered. Not only did Joaquin depict a joker we have all been craving for, but Todd allowed us to see it in an unimaginable way. Throughout watching the movie, I found myself at the edge of the seat on numerous occasions, unable to stop myself from sympathising with 'Arthur'. Arthur a deadly villain deserving to be locked away in Arkham Asylum for the rest of his life, yet nothing can stop us from thinking about his detrimental childhood, the lies he's been told early on his life. Thus, was born the 'joker' from shear loneliness and self-deprivation a fundamental consequence caused by his mentally insane mother.There were many intense scenes which were so realistic it shook me to the core, I found myself gasping in shock whilst watching the movie. The way Joaquin laughed, smiled, cried and even those intense glare he gave spoke so much emotion. It was truly magnificent seeing an actor showing the characters emotion through their eyes.The character study is so prominent, the repetition of the music when the joker is at his best allows us to really connect the dots, it really shows us the birth of the villain. The birth we've all been waiting for. The final couple of scenes was superb, the way they ended it off was remarkable and well-rounded it links to so many starting point of different batman shows/movies.I really recommend watching this if you have a natural craving for a slow burners, which shows the psychological making of an insane villain."

Particularly those of us who can't "relate" to feeling alone and isolated. This is the same mentality that would put the blame on "mean people" or society in general, and then specifically on a mental health professional rather than the individual who decided to go out and murder.Victim stance is far worse than a distorted, personal-responsibility-absolving crutch, it is a powerful, addictive, debilitating narcotic already being mass produced/consumed in our present society.

Like a critic said: this film doesn't have much to say and says it loudly. The Gotham, Arkham world isn't fresh; same old recycled stuff; seen the TV series Gotham? It's like a bigger budget version of Gotham, focusing on Joker, compacted into a movie. The film's cinematic and atmospheric. But I preferred Joker's back story in Batman (1989). This film's too realistic: I don't want a superhero movie (or in this case a super villain movie) set in such a realistic world. Put simply: a guy named Arthur (Joaquin Phoenix) has problems; he lives with his mom; he works as a clown; he's fired and gradually becomes Joker, leading a social movement of disgruntled mob-mentality citizens dressed as clowns seeking to overthrow Gotham's elite. In the end there's a riot; the mob-mentality disgruntled citizens of Gotham are dressed as clowns. Wow. As if a TV show would invite a loser like Arthur to be a guest; TV host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro) makes fun of Joker who, at this point's a loser named Arthur trying comedy at a stand up club; a videotaped clip's played and ridiculed on the Murray Franklin TV show: it was that bad. Then Arthur's invited to be a guest on the show: guys like Arthur aren't invited to be guests on David Letterman style TV shows; celebrities are, not mentally ill guys like Arthur. The film's all atmosphere and impact. But it lacks substance. I would've liked this as a Batman movie; the epic scale would make for an awesome Batman v Joker film. Joker isn't interesting enough to justify an entire movie spent on him. I remember reading a review of Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018) which pointed out that Han Solo's back story isn't interesting. Same here. And it's not like we haven't seen Joker before; Batman (1989) managed to do Joker's story, without it taking up the whole movie. 5/10."

Sign in to vote.,"Brilliant movie elegantly bordering between mass cinema and films d'auter","The tons of hype around this anticipated novelty pushed me away from watching this movie as soon as it came out. It seemed to be enormously overrated but surprisingly turns out isn't from here at all. Honestly, not being a big fan of typical action-filled superhero movies, I exprected a lot of empty pathos and pretentiousness. Though, in fact, this movie is much deeper than it was inherently expected.Joker is an unbearable tragedy. The story of a true man who are constantly struggling for the right to be a valued member of society. Joker is about something deeply personal. It reveals all the scariest expressions of mental instability, non-acceptance and isolation. But it is little wonder that the consequences of social attitude to the people with mental illnesses will be surely reflected someday in such ways like it was shown in the movie. There is actually nothing wrong with Arthur Fleck - there is something wrong with society. Therefore, it is significant to feel a responsibility for each person we are talking to, every action we are making and even every thought that comes up in our mind.Undoubtedly, I wish to note the weird brilliance of Joaquin performance - remarkably my own personal discovery of the year. Perfect."

You know how some movies are 'chick flicks', others 'date movies.' Others still are couple of guys wanting an action movie. This movie, although well written, directed, casted, etc., is very much like walking on broken glass. I honestly can't recall another movie, though I'm sure there are several, that were this painful to watch. It took me 4 separate tries to complete it.If you decide to watch this movie, pick the right sort of spot, someone who has a strong stomach."

What might have unsettled me most on this viewing was the guy sitting next to me, because of course these are always sitting right next to me, who was laughing at everything the Joker did. Everyone else was as shocked, engrossed and completely silent as me. You could hear a pin drop, and once a phone, but that man was pretty much laughing throughout. At all of the deaths and at every smile or gesture of the Joker. I really don't understand that one bit. That this did not take me out of the film is probably the biggest praise I can give Joker. Obviously, Joaquin Phoenix nailed it and is the film's biggest plus. A fully believable portrayal of a complex figure that does not stand for anything and has no clue what it wants, but only knows he can't keep taking it any more. I don't think the film makes him out to be a normally awesome dude who just had some bad experiences in life and now is shooting people, and so should you. No, I think it just shows this man and asks us what to make of him. How come no one was taking him seriously till it was too late? What can we do to prevent people capable of acts like these, from executing them? And many more questions. It's a puzzling story in various ways and a movie where I can fully understand the people who dislike it. It makes you feel absolutely horrible for a while. At least that's the effect it has on me right now, but I do think that makes total sense. It is a snapshot of our current time, as well as any other time really, but is relevant nonetheless. It shows for example, masses on the streets hopelessly worshipping someone although they have no idea, nor care, what this person actually thinks or stands for, or if it does. Ultimately the movie seems to be about utter chaos and that, needless to say, always resonates. This film is a lot to process and these are just some feelings and thoughts I have about it at this time. I'll maybe leave a more detailed review at a later date once I've seen it again. By the way, yes the movie is not exactly brilliant or all that new but it does what it does effectively and is extremely stirring, at times difficult to watch, and that is most likely how a story like this should be told. Shoutout to the great cinematography, editing and especially to the score. Hildur Guðnadóttir is an incredible talent. Annoyingly Todd Phillips is a quite the idiot, yes, but many morons have made good films. That has always been the case, it is just more apparent nowadays. So I don't know what to tell you. It is what it is. Somehow this is a great film against the many odds."

I was only interested in seeing how Phoenix does as Joker but I expected the film to be run of the mill and lack substance. Well, it was a masterpiece.I would just say to anyone judging without actually watching, give it a try. If only to see Joaquin Phoenix top Heath Ledger as Joker, which I didn't think would ever happen after Dark Knight.There was a hell of a lot more substance to this than I expected. This was a masterful slow burning character study, showing the transformation of a downtrodden, mentally ill sociopath, into The Joker. And yeah, it's one of the darkest and most uncomfortable comedies you will ever see but it's set up and done very well. Visually great, soundtrack great and Phoenix was unbelievable.This is getting a lot of bad reviews from critics who I guess were made uncomfortable but there are thousands of senselessly violent movies and this was dark as you get, but not senseless.Metacritic currently has an average rating from critics of 57/100, with both the metacritic and imdb users rating it 9.2/10. It used to be that I'd put more stock in the critics than average viewer ratings but it's getting really hard to take modern reviewers seriously when you see the countless generic and badly constructed comic book adaptations and new Star Wars films get a better critical response than an actual piece of art like Joker."

This, to me, was dull and boring. Unfortunately, that is not the worst description: It was annoying and painful to endure.The impression to me is a neutral actor simply making motions and sounds as told like a robot. To bad music. The painful part was how boring you might imagine this would be to sit through as well as doing things just to do them.Picture a guy standing in a park. He randomly starts to roll around on the ground.Maybe he starts laughing for a while.Maybe he whatever and then it's over. Oh boy, so entertaining. Just like this movie.Actor mas as well be a robot. Dumb actions. Dumb sounds. Dumb music. Dumb plot and yes it is, because the idea of the story is good, but the implimentaiton is just bad.After watching this I felt like I'd been forced to sit through an 18 hour day of dealing with terrible people at a job that pays tips. But the people don't tip. Go home with that empty feeling as well as mentally feeling abused all day."

I get what they were going for with the telling of how joker became the joker but honestly, it was on the edge of becoming a snore fest. I kept waiting for more to happen and will say the ending maybe last 10-15 mins was when it started to liven up. I get that it's a deep movie, where they really want you to see the depth of the character but I think it could of been sped up a little bit. Joaquin Phoenix did an amazing job at being the joker and I think he should be in the next Batman movie for sure. This movie was neither horrible or great for me.

Because , one of the best movies to me of all time is " The dark Knight " and heath ledger in this movie did the Joker's character in a way that is hard to beat ! For some reason in between all the actors who did the Joker's character , heath ledger did reach a point where no one can reach or far beyond reach ! If you don't know what I'm talking about, watch the movie again and you will know ! But that doesn't necessarily will prevent me from watching Joaquin's version ! Or even liking it ! Joaquin without doubt is an excellent actor , he's already proven to be in many previous roles and I'm sure he will add to the character some of his brilliant performance but I believe the movie needs more than Joaquin's Talent to beat Heath's version of the joker ! I'll watch the movie with no expectations so I can enjoy it as just a MOVIE."

Through the first 30 minutes or so of the movie, it isn't as dark or gripping as the trailers portray it. But after the subway scene (if you haven't seen it yet, you'll know exactly what I mean when you do see it), the mood of the movie immediately snaps to dark and disturbing and the viewer can feel it. The grittiness and truly twisted nature of Arthur Fleck's persona helps create the most dark and gripping story since Silence of the Lambs.

Who doesn't want a Gotham's Joker adaptation? I found myself very anticipated to watch this flick. When I saw the film I left feeling like I watched an amazing movie. The cinematography was excellent. Had a lot of thought provoking shots that excelled in creating very dramatic scenes that supplied constant emotion and the "edgy" feel if you will. The story made you sympathize with the Arthur and why he became the villain he is. We see a man ostracized from society for being quite different. He has mental health issues and he really doesn't know his place in the world. He is peculiar which draws negative attention and back lash from people in general. The story in itself delivered in giving an adaptation of the Joker. My only problem with the film, isn't in itself the movie was bad in a sense. My problem is that we as people find these type of stories to be good to watch. Nothing about this film is "good". There are dark films that make us learn something about who we are as people. In the Joker Gotham shows a society in which we shun the black sheep. We hate and ridicule the unfortunate to be hung in effigy for what is considered normal. If you do not act this way you are therefore different and should be mocked and laughed at. This is relevant especially in today's day in age where people on the internet satirize celebrities forgetting they are regular people. What is equally bad is we satirize regular people who are just like you and me. Who at there core are human beings who should be treated with respect and dignity; regardless of what you believe in. What saddens me is that even though the Joker is fiction there are people like Arthur Fleck who experience the same struggles everyday and are one day away from taking their anger out on the world. The kindness you extend to others, you extend to yourself. On the contrary, the evil you extend to the world, you extend to yourself. I think this film is a sad reminder on what the masses can do in helping create the villain that ironically we end up idolizing and put on display to sell tickets. I would like to think we are better than that as a human race, but even through my past and my actions: I am sad to say we might not be. You realize we as humans you, me, and everybody else are stupid and unknowingly we could be creating the next Arthur Fleck. We don't know half the time why we are laughing at something not knowing there is a deep suffering to some of the humor we use. Decide for yourself what is worth your enjoyment.This movie overall sucked looking back and I am sorry I brought my little brother to see this."

Sign in to vote.,"The joke is that...","Preface"The Joker" is far from a social film about the poor and the rich, and certainly not about the Joker, whom we know from comics. All this is a wrapper in which the viewer can easily lose the essence of this picture. Having all our ideas that the Joker should not be such an extremely dull and weak character, as shown in the film, we miss the important thing, that first of all this is an author's film under the wing of Todd Phillips. Yes, he is a little clumsy in storytelling, and the direction is sometimes both outstanding and pretentious, but all this does not exclude one fact... The film has a high significance in a world where comic book films must be simple, regardless of what kind of ton of performance they are: dark or funny. This shows that the audience (taking into account the box office) is ready even for such films, where their value for the most part lies in what the author wants to say, and not in what huge money the producers will grab."Is it me... or is the whole world going crazy ?"The protagonist of the story about a psychopathic killer is Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), who, being under the yoke of the dangerous, his inhabitants of the city of Gotham, where everyone is ready to bite each other's throats for nothing, continues to remain optimistic, no matter what. He wants to become a stand-up comedian with his non-standard sense of humor to see his share of charm in the manifestation of violence. And in general, all this flows for the entire film. The main character is reconciled with the fact that his whole life, which seemed to him a tragedy, was actually a comedy, a joke, in which only he understands the punchline. But even here it's not so simple. The film is based on Arthur Fleck, and not on anyone else, which means that if you look at all this correctly through the eyes of the main character, then together with him you can catch the very joke that he does not tell.I would like to write separately about how the musical accompaniment and camerawork make this film truly a masterpiece. I could talk for hours about the scene in which Arthur is dancing in the toilet, based on these cinema tools that convey a strong visual and audio narrative. So I will limit myself to the fact that the cameraman (Lawrence Sher) skillfully emphasizes the spiritual world of Arthur, as at this time the composer (Hildur Gudnadouttir) gives out music that is unusually creep with a share of romanticism, conveying the importance of this world for the hero. As for directing, everything is much more complicated here.Todd Phillips understands what the film is about, but when watching it, it seems that the director does not skillfully observe the narrative of the story, and sometimes even greatly exaggerates, adding so much eventfulness to it that the viewer will start to have a headache after that. The director weighs too much of the madhouse on Arthur, which makes you wonder how you can not hang yourself right after that. Some moments can be cut out (a love line; a false father, etc.). After all, there are already plenty of topics in the film that should already be competently developed in the course of history, but instead, the director overloads the viewer with unnecessary subtexts in the second act of the film, making it monotonous to hell, and that's why it's tiring.ResultSo what is the Joker's joke? To understand it, I want you to pay attention to how the scene in which teenagers beat Arthur is filmed, and the scene where little Bruce Wayne loses his parents, and then think about it yourself. For me personally, the film is not a masterpiece, but I will not deny the fact that this film will be a masterpiece for you. For the most part, the only thing that pleases me is that such a heavy drama with a comic theme has collected a huge amount of money with a modest budget, which means that it is possible that films of this kind will continue in huge numbers. This film was not about the Joker, but rather about the fact that everyone can become a Joker, and it only takes one bad day for this.9 out of 10."

Joaquin Phoenix truly captivates this horrific character and gives us a disturbing, Oscar worthy performance. While watching the film I never thought of this person as Phoenix but instead I was convinced that I was watching the tribulations of the deeply troubled Arthur Fleck. Phillip's camerawork was surprisingly amazing in this film as well. There are amazing shots in the film that not only show the bleakness of the worn down streets of Gotham City but also slowly reveal Fleck's decent into madness. Don't believe the critics saying not to see it because this film is amazing."

My expectations were low, so you'd think I would be pleased if it were better than I thought, but, no, unfortunately all the movie did was confirm my suspicions that it's not a very good movie.All those praising it, saying not to listen to the bad reviews (to put it nicely) obviously have an agenda, as anyone that saw Morbius, and gave it anything above a 6, has low standards, or has something to gain by doing so. Those giving it a 10? No question, they are just trying to raise the rating. I wouldn't say things like "worst movie ever" because I think those reviews are silly. Same with those saying it was a 10. Really? In your cinematic opinion, this movie was as good as Shawshank Redemption? Or The Godfather? Or any other movies in IMDb's top 250?I think there are very few times where I rate something a 10, so it really has to be earned, to me. Even some of my favorite movies, that I think were pretty well done, still don't earn a full 10, in my opinion.Anyway, if you want to see it for yourself, and form your own opinion, feel free, of course.

Leto has no real fun with this role as he seriously underplays the drive and obsessiveness of Morbius, but there's barely a character, hardly a story, and once the hook is revealed it becomes pretty generic, plus the Matrix-inspired echolocation effects are woeful. Might work for fans of the vampire genre, but Wesley Snipes already did this kind of thing better back in the 90s; it's not a good sign when the (expected) Easter eggs are more intriguing than anything else that happens in the rest of the movie. **"

The god-awful clones of Tarantino pouring out of indie and mainstream studios alike should not, however, detract from the brilliance and subtlety of this movie. It works simply because those moments of brilliance (I have to admit I know the whole "Jules redemption-speech" by heart) that its imitators lack come in the midst of the camp and gore they all do so well. Tarantino alone uses an adolescent obsession with shallowness and morbidity to high satirical effect--like all great films (or even novels), this movie sets itself into a two-dimensional genre (absurd, pop-culture, comic-book situations) and then undermines its own genre by exposing the heart and soul underneath. There are too many points in the movie in which this happens to mention, but a few come to mind: the blown kiss from Vincent to Mia at the end of the first (or maybe second) story; the death of Vincent; the obvious emotional dedication of Butch to his wife at the end of his own story; Vincent's unwillingness to believe in his own supernatural salvation without realizing he's doomed; and, of course, the climactic speech. With the exception of Jules's final words, many of these moments seem at first to be horrifying or funny--but this is only because they fit so well into the flow of the script. A second glance shows them to be moments so poignant that the only reason they work is because they are so unique to the characters and their situations. The changes in each (or the lack of change) come, in a sense, as they individually choose to either drive for them or fall behind. Most die-hard fans of the movie, I'm sure, have heard the story of the briefcase and the band-aids on the back of Wallace's neck (the entire movie being a quest to bring back his stolen soul), and although Tarantino has denied it, he can't deny that the movie is full of such heroic themes: escape by trial, the reclamation of past, love as both physical salvation and personal security, a will to believe in something beyond one's own selfish world. I won't say that if you don't like this movie that you're mistaken or ignorant, but I think that Tarantino puts his audience into settings much like his characters are in: cheap, full of profanity and nastiness, fleeting. The best of them break through; I think he asks that anyone watching do the same."

I think Tarantino's genius does play a part in this film, and the product is substantial; but Reservoir Dogs is better.All the characters use witty, random dialogue about European hamburgers and the sexual implications of foot massages, but to what avail? I mean, as fun as it is to hear and watch, I just found that the whole movie lacked something. Maybe a little bit more editing would've done the trick; maybe it was something else. I can't quite put my finger on it. Don't get me wrong. I think this is a classic Tarantino movie. I enjoyed Samuel L. Jackson's quotable lines, as well as a couple of outstanding scenes. (The OD, the Big Date, the scene where Harvey Keitel gets rid of the body, etc.) As a whole, the movie does work. But some minor details would make it even better.The storyline of Bruce Willis and Ving Rhames was a little much. (Did Ving *really* have to get raped?) I know Tarantino just wanted to add some shock value to his film, but even for a person who doesn't mind that kind of thing in movies I found it a little extreme.Oh, and one more thing: I learned that "zapateria" means "shoe store" in Spanish, courtesy of Butch. ;-)HandHStudios Rating: 8/10HandHStudios"

I mean, about appropriating other movies, like a blender. I think it's really funny at the time I'm seeing it, but then, I don't know, there's a void there. Some of the references are flat, just pop culture." - Harmony Korine "It's like watching a schoolboy's fantasy of violence and sex, which normally Tarantino would be ******* alone to in his bedroom while his mother is making him baked beans downstairs. Only this time he's got Harvey Weinstein behind him and it's on a million screens." - Nick Broomfield "Thirty years ago it would have been widely accepted that objective knowledge about society and history was an asset for a filmmaker. Today, such an attitude is considered a hindrance. This is a temporary state of affairs, but a costly and destructive one. Art, including bad art, has consequences." - David Walsh Quentin Tarantino directs "Pulp Fiction", a shamelessly lurid homage to early B-movies, printed pulp fiction (the dime-store tales of the 1940s-50s, and later pulp imitators - sometimes called "new pulp" - like Elmore Leonard and Charles Bukowski, whose own "Pulp" was released in 1994), Robert Aldrich ("Kiss Me Deadly"), "Farewell My Lovely", "Pickup on South Street" and Godard ("Band of Outsiders", "Vivre sa Vie", "Alphaville"). Nods to "It's a Wonderful Life", "Truck Turner" (the same comic monologues), "Karate Kiba" (Jackson's religious monologues repeated verbatim), "On The Waterfront", "The Colour of Money" ("character" vs "having character" conversation), "The Parent Trap" (Uma drawing an animated square on screen, also from "The Three Little Bops"), "Repo Man" (glowing briefcase; see also Aldrich), "Charley Varrick" (lifted lines, as well as the torture scene), "Psycho", "Lili" (everything about the Fabienne character), "Easy Rider", "God of Gamblers" (violence whenever Travolta goes to the bathroom), "Three Days of the Condor" (Vincent's death), "Shoot the Piano Player", "Jules and Jim", "The Panic in Needle Park" (the whole overdose fiasco), "Policewoman" (stylized credit sequence), and "The Night Of The Hunter" come next, all shoehorned before or after an extended sequence in a movie-themed restaurant in which all of Tarantino's references sit back, chill out and relax.The film is dense with allusions (Uma's two dances are taken directly from "Band of Outsiders" and "Vivre sa Vie", as is her haircut), cribbed shots and referenced dialogue, Tarantino packing the film to the brim with nods to esoteric art films, mainstream fare, trashy exploitation films and television programmes ("Kung Fu", "Captain Kangaro", "Happy Days", "Cops"). Characters likewise either work on TV shows ("Force Five"), knowingly repeat lines from movies ("Zardoz", "Guns of Navarone" etc) and documentaries (Scorsese's "American Boy" is the source of Lance's needle instructions) or are themselves named after songs ("Flock of Seagulls"), movies or movie characters (eg Tony "Rocky Horror" named after the "Rocky Horror Picture Show", "English Bob" after a character in "Unforgiven" and Keitel's "The Wolf" based on a similar character in "Victor the Cleaner"). Posters of countless films are likewise littered throughout, as well as references to film directors (a "Douglas Sirk steak" - aka a steak with "All That Heaven Allows"). Some of the allusions are brief (boxer Bruce Willis' comes home after a fight and yells his girl's name like Stallone does in "Rocky"), whilst some are deliberately extended and toyed with.Some actors in the film even acknowledge their own roles in other films, Christopher Walken's character just coming back from "Deer Hunter's" Nam, Travolta's echoing his role in "Saturday Night Fever" and Ving Rhames' Marsellus Wallace delivering a monologue exactly like his character in "Casualties of War". Rhames' gimp suit encounter even echoes another gimp suit encounter in "The People Under The Stairs", also with Rhames. Cinematic pop cultural references even bleed into print references (Travolta reading "Modesty Blaise" etc), while the film's self-consciously fake process shots recall Dick Richards' noirs. Even the famous "Quarter Pounder" monologue is cribbed, and much of the character ramblings recall Jean Paul Belmondo in "Breathless".The film is structured as a series of short stories – all loosely connected and deliberately trashy – but within these stories are themselves characters who constantly take time out to tell equally digressive short stories. In this way the film is a tale about people telling tales, and so plays like a celebration of oration, of yapping, of a hundred and twenty years of seedy storytelling. Ironically, the film's best short story is that in which the characters decide to "say nothing". To shut up.Under postmodernism, art is inherently self absorbed, self-reflexive, de-structured, de-centred, fragmented, parasitic and churned out by artists whose media-saturated landscapes become "all that there is to reality". Such artists live in a kind of cocoon, seeking only to replicate past pleasures. This is a cinema of artifacts and furnishings. Of attitude, copied poses and interchangeable and indistinguishable references. Here, life is only an extension of media, everything is false and all that matters are gestures and role playing. And like other postmodern films, Tarantino's aesthetic is a seductive kind of hyper-stylisation, everything not only in quotes and supremely self conscious, but celebratory of self consciousness."Pulp Fiction" is entertaining (and its narrative has a breezy, liberative quality), much better written than its imitators and one passage in particular, which plays with the classic cliché of "the bodyguard and the bosses wife", is graceful, low key and romantic. Much of the film is surprisingly inhumane, though, a kind of jokey 1970s exploitation movie in which people are either doped up, stabbed by needles, raping black men or coldly slaughtering teens while making grand speeches. Because the film exists in a certain moral vacuum ("It's just a film", "It's supposed to be trash", "It's pulp ****ing fiction!"), stuff like anal rape and murder are all played for snickers and kicks.8/10 - The "Repo Man" of the 90s?"

The script is brilliant, the film is great despite being near 150 minutes and EVERY actor/actress plays a great part.I did find the film confusing the first time I saw it but after I had watched it everything made sense.Every character in the film has depth. Take John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson. They're not just playing a pair of emotionless hitmen like most films portray. They're real people with real feelings and real emotions. The same goes for Uma Thurman as Mia Wallace, Ving Rhames as Marsellus Wallace and Harvey Keitel as The Wolf. They are without a doubt the best characters ever in a film and I cannot praise them-and Quentin Tarantino-enough. As for Bruce Willis as Butch Coolidge, well I think this is the best ever role for the underrated Bruce Willis who is such an interesting character.(POSSIBLE SPOILERS) The scenes are great throughout. One scene I enjoyed was where Butch Coolidge and Marsellus Wallace are at the mercy of a homosexual pawn shop owner and his twisted friend Zed (and some freak called the Gimp). It was a bit of an uneasy scene to watch but the reason I enjoyed it was because Butch Coolidge came back to save Marsellus Wallace who was at the mercy of homosexual rapist Zed. Moments earlier Butch and Marsellus had been enemies but Butch rushed back and probably saved Marsellus's life. I found that quite interesting. In my opinion it showed us that there may be honour even among thieves.Of course, there are many other great scenes too numerous to mention. Pulp Fiction opens with a bang and finishes with a bang. Anybody who hasn't seen the film is strongly advised by me to get the video or DVD as soon as possible.Brilliant masterpiece! Well done to all those involved in it!"

The movie's opening scene is in a diner,where none-too bright criminal lovebirds Honey Bunny(Amanda Plummer)and Pumpkin(Tim Roth)discuss their future. They're tired of holding up liquor stores and 7/11's:too many shopkeepers with too many guns They decide to switch to diners,in broad daylight,which are full of people with wallets and purses. The pre-credits sequence ends as Honey Bunny leaps up,gun in hand,and shouts that it's a stick-up. The next sequence begins in a car,as hit men Jules(Samuel Jackson)and Vincent Vega(John Travolta),who's just returned from an extended stay in Europe,talks about everything under the sun-at least,and everything that interests them,from what a Quarter Pounder is called in France to TV Pilots. They're on their way to pay a visit to three clean-cut,middle class youths who've make the mistake of double crossing their boss,Marsellus. Jules is especially interested in the fact that Vincent has been assigned to escort Marsellus' wife Mia while the big man is out of town;there are pitfalls inherent in spending time with the boss's wife. Their visit with the college boys takes a nasty turn for the worst after they briefcase-which emits a strange,radiant light-that Marsellus has sent them to retrieve. This is where Jackson quotes a part from the Bible(and it is one of the best performances throughout the film)before the entourage of taking out the youths.We see next Vincent on his way to keep his date with Mia(Uma Thurman). He stops off to visit his dealer,Lance(Eric Stoltz),buys some heroin,and shoots up before arriving at Marsellus' home. Vincent and Mia have dinner at Jackrabbit Slim's,a 1950s theme restaurant,then Vincent takes her home. While he is in the bathroom,she discovers the heroin in his pocket,mistakes it for cocaine and snorts some. When he comes out,she's comatose:in a panic,he takes her to Lance's where they administer a shot of adrenaline to the heart. She recovers,and the evening ends with Mia and Vincent promising that the events will be their secret. In the next sequence,we meet Butch(Bruce Willis),a washed up boxer who is being paid for by Marsellus(Ving Rhames) to takes a dive in a upcoming fight,but Butch has other plans--who then flees with his girlfriend Fabianne(Maria de Medeirous) and get out of the country. The next morning he learns that Fabianne has forgotten the watch he inherited from his father who fought in the war(Christopher Walken),and goes back to the apartment to retrieve it,but instead finds the watch,and then driving back to his girlfriend,Butch runs down Marsellus,who tries to kill him,and from there Marsellus chases Butch into a pawnshop when turns out to be sadistic hillbilly sex murderers which Butch escapes while they're assaulting Marsellus,but his sense of honor makes him goes back and kills the sadistic suckers in a bloody outburst of gore,and from there Marsellus forgives him but tells Butch to leave town and he and his girlfriend ride off into the sunset.The final sequence returns to Jules and Vincent's dilemma where they killed off the young victims,but a fourth one lives. In the car Jules claims that they were saved by a miracle,but while they're driving and talking,Vincent accidentally shoots the passenger,and they find somewhere to hide out while they clean up there gore-splattered car full of bone fragments. They descend on Jimmy(Quentin Tarantino),a close friend of Jules,but they have to be out before Jimmy's wife returns. However,Marsellus sends The Wolf(Harvey Keitel)to get them out of their situation and from after their taxing morning,Jules and Vincent decide to have breakfast in the same diner that Honey Bunny and Pumpkin and about to rob. As customers hit the floor,Jules remains calm while Vincent is in the diner's restroom. He refuses to give up the briefcase,overpowers Pumpkin,talks Honey Bunny out of opening fire,and eventually defuses the whole situation. At the end,Vincent and Jules leave the diner,still talking about Jules' plans to devote himself over to God.On the commemoration of its tenth anniversary,PULP FICTION is a witty,violent and unexpectedly redemptive tour de force,in which he juggles three overlapping stories of love,betrayal,and murder as business-as-usual. The movie skims along on a sea of lurid clichés,but are as twisted,transfigured,and given astonishingly fresh-life to its cast of characters as the day this film was released. PULP FICTION also pays homage to its B-movie past while existing comfortably it is own perfectly realized world. It also pays great homage to the action-packed blaxploitation films of its era and the crime-noirs thrillers of the 1970's which set the tone for the other Quentin Tarantino films like RESERVOIR DOGS(1992),JACKIE BROWN(1997),and most recently the KILL BILL(2003,2004) trilogies. Oscar-Winner for Best Original Screenplay(Quentin Tarantino),and Oscar nominations for Best Picture,Best Director,and so forth,PULP FICTION is a cinematic masterpiece of film especially with all the violent action-and there's plenty with some of its explicit graphic in detail is very paramount indeed. Check the extended DVD version as well. Congradulations,Quentin Tarantino on your 10th Anniversary of this landmark classic."

DON'T READ UNLESS YOU HAVE SEEN THE MOVIE OR YOU HAVE NO DESIRE TO.I'm reading a lot of these messages condemning Tarantino for making a pro-drug, pro-violence movie?  Hello?  Did we see different movies?Just because a director SHOWS drugs or violence doesn't mean that they condone them.  Did anyone watch Uma Thurman's overdose scene and react by craving smack?  And about the violence...of the three leads (Travolta, Jackson, and Willis), only Travolta is committed to a life of violence, and he ends up dead in a toilet.  Willis' character is redeemed by saving the life of his arch enemy, and Jackson's "holy" revelation leads him to reject the violent life of a hitman.Any film that takes place in the criminal underworld has to show the viewer elements of sex, drugs, and violence or else lose all credibility.  Deeper analysis of this film, however, shows it to be one of the most morally present films of the '90's."

Truly a masterpiece.","What can there be said about this movie that hasn't already been stated a thousand times before. It's nearly perfect in every single regard. The writing and dialogue are out of this world. It's endlessly rewatchable and quotable. Anything that comes out of Samuel L. Jackson's mouth is cinematic gold at its finest. The dialogue itself actually makes you feel like you're watching real people, someone you could actually talk with in real life. Take Vincent (John Travolta), for example. He's a murdering drug addict who doesn't feel much besides annoyance when he accidently shoots someone in the face. But because if the dialogue, you actually feel sad when Butch (Bruce Willis) kills him.All of the cast is perfect, but Sam Jackson and John Travolta as Jules and Vincent are the clear standouts. They have unbelievable chemistry with one another and the banter between the two are some of my favorite parts from the movie. All of the other cast members are amazing as well, Bruce Willis gave the performance of his lifetime, along with Uma Thurman, Tim Roth, Harvey Keitel and especially Ving Rhames. Also, brief as his screentime was, Christopher Walken gave my favorite movie monologue ever.So that brings us to the story. From a simple storytelling standpoint, this is one of the most unique movies out there. It's tense, always unoredictable and a hell of a lot of fun. Despite the story parts being out of order, it still feels infinitely more focused than most of the entertainment released today.Because of all of these things mentioned above, I consider Pulp Fiction to be a masterpiece. It is the one movie that I continuously find myself coming back to and never get bored."

Sign in to vote.,"A Masterpiece with the strongest screenplay and acting you will ever see!","Well, the first time I saw Pulp Fiction I was kinda bored with the dialogue, but I still knew it was a 'quality' film(I saw it like a year ago). The second time I saw it with my parents, and I ended up hating it. The reason is because my parents were SO mad at me for seeing the film, they despised it, saying it had drugs, it was pointless, and the gay rape scene really shocked them. They told me to throw the DVD away. Wel, that hate has stayed on with me, but since I am making a top 55 list, I want to see where it places. I mean, if I hate it, then it wont be that high, YET I know it is a good film.I watched it for a third time, and I have to say, this time I enjoyed it the most. I watched it by myself in my room, just hearing the great dialogues. The screenplay is probably the best for someone to read. The way the film starts, and goes in unchronological order is simply well done. It was a genius idea. The memorable lines, dialogues between Mia Wallace and Vincent Vega, the great scenes between Vincent and Jules. Yes, it is very dark, not in a scary way, but in a comedic disturbing way, and that is probably why my parents hated it so much. I can say that it truly is a landmark of a film. It created a whole new path for films. It began great dialogue scenes between characters, and it is the mother of all 'character developments'. There are a lot of scenes that seem 'unimportant', but that is the beauty of Pulp Fiction. That is also the reason why a lot of people hate it, but to deny it's brilliance is so not understandable.The film says so little, yet so much, It is a film about god. That is what I believe, since Jules goes through revelations. The whole film is to show how cruel the world can be, having some of the weirdest, most shocking, disturbing scenes ever. A man talks to a child about how his father and himself had to have a gold watch up their asses for years... How insane! We see a man who is called 'The Gimp' and how he helps another man rape other men. We see a woman talking about how she wants a pot belly, and that she wants blueberry pancakes. We see A man talking to a kid who is sitting in the back of the car, then the kid is accidentally shot in the face... These are just some of the situations that happen. Not to mention really famous scenes that come from this movie, like an overdose, and probably one of the greatest hostage crisis in history, in a restaurant! Another aspect why this film works so well is because of the acting. A great certain of performances in this film look like they should all deserve Oscar nominations at least. The most notable must be Samuel L. Jackson as Jules Winnfield. His performance is so strong and exhilarating and out of the water that you can tell he got some buzz, and he should have actually won the Oscar(under leading, because he really had the same amount of screen time that Travolta had). Uma Thurman's performance as Mia Wallace also deserved the Oscar. Her acting was so fresh, she really made the character her own. John Travolta was also very good, but I think there were better. Amanda Plummer as Honey Bunny in the restaurant scenes, she really also deserves an Oscar nomination. Tim Roth also was worthy of it. Of course, the reason the actors are able to shine is because of the screenplay(the best part of the film). It is surely in the top 3 I have ever read.Pulp Fiction is a Masterpiece, whether you like it or not. It surely helped for a lot of film events, such as the unchronological order of scenes, the way dialogue is written, as well as mystery(what's in the case?) This is a force to be reckoned with."

It's about gangsters, and life in their context.Familiar phrase sex drugs and rock n roll plus killing sums up the lives the thugs' lives in this movie. It's a very stylized life of gangs, and I guess that's why the movie's called pulp fiction.Travolta and Samuel Jackson plays the hit men. Uma Thurman is the wife of the gang boss, and Bruce Willis plays the boxer who's on the run. Four of them causes/gets into all sorts of mayhem, and in the end there seems to be no conclusion to the story.The story is bit schizophrenic, and is like conglomeration of short stories in no particular context. It's not an intelligent movie, but it's not dumb either. It glorifies some aspect of gang life. The whole movie has a bluesy feel to it, and maybe that's what the audience resonates to about this movie.Irresponsibility's of the characters makes you want to live a life like them if only for a moment. The whole movie is like a moving poster of life from the past."

Spoilers","It's tragic that Quentin Tarentino has some sort of phobia about trying to follow up Pulp Fiction with an equally brilliant film (Jackie Brown was good, though). Still, some directors only do a project every few years, but someone like Quentin needs to be more active in Hollywood considering the drek coming out every week.Pulp Fiction, which was the best film of 1994 no matter what Tom Hanks and his disciples think, stands as one of the best movies ever made. A brilliant study in the life of the lives of professional hitmen in L.A. as well as a segment of a boxer who is trying to avoid the hitmen after squelching on a deal with the hitmen's boss and then finds himself in a nightmarish situation when he bumps into the boss while trying to return to his hideout.The film goes back and forth in time (a period of a week, give or take a day), and some scenes shown earlier in the film will be played out again when other characters are in that scene. Tarentino's style of storytelling has been oft imitated.Everyone in the film delivers a superb performance, and even as despicable as some of them are, you can't help but be mesmerized by them. John Travolta and Sam Jackson shine as the hitmen; Travolta's Vinnie Vega is a heroin-addict who doesn't seem to have a code of ethics in his life, while Jackson's Jules Winnfield is a man with ethics and religious convictions who feel that he is doing good in the world. Uma Thurman is Mia Wallace, the boss' wife whose only married to him because he's money. Bruce Willis plays a boxer in the second act named Butch who was supposed to take a dive for the Boss, Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames), and not only didn't, but killed the man in their match, who discovers that his girlfriend didn't bring his heirloom watch to the hideout and has to get it from his apartment where Travolta is waiting to kill him. He catches Travolta in an embarrassing situation and kills him. Then when driving back, he sees the boss, who he tries to run over, but he misses and he crashes the car and the two chase and fight each other into a pawn shop where they end up being captives by two twisted homosexuals who want them for sex.In the third act, Vega and Winnfield are taking one of the small-potato criminals to have him punished by Wallace, and Vega accidentally shoots him in the head, ruining the car and bloodying their clothes. They end up having to see Harvey Keitel, who plays The Wolf to help them dispose of the body, clean the car, and get them clean clothes. Tarentino delivers a brief but explosive performance as the owner of the house where they will hide their dirty work.Finally, the first scene which features Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer as Bonnie And Clyde wannabes who try to rob a diner and Winnfield, who has changed from an experience earlier in the day when they were not killed by a madman in the earlier hit, tells them that it's wrong for them to do so.With great dialogue, a superb soundtrack, and tons of memorable moments, this is a definite winner. A must see, it would take forever to talk about it's greatness. See it!"

Just when you think it's heading for the fast lane, it slows down.  When you think it's going to drag, it speeds up.  Dread Travolta about to whiz around on the dance floor, relax.(SPOILER:  Assuming Bonnie's going to be white?  Nope you'd be wrong.)  Full of action, irony, intrigue, twists, turns, humor, cynicism, raunchiness, tenderness, lightness, darkness, heaviness, this film has it all.  I have watched this movie no less than 20 times and never fail to see something new or "get" another aspect of it (except the friggin time sequence & whatever the hell is in that briefcase!).

Sign in to vote.,"Disjointed, still made sense though!","Never had the chance to watch this movie the first time around, the movie that catapulted John Travolta's acting career back into orbit after many repeated failures since Saturday Night Fever. As in other Quentin Tarantino's films, the layout of the movie is different and is full of gore, violence and flowery explicit language. Bruce Willis career too had a kick-start here. I kind of liked it with its unique brand of humour, the right chemistry between the main hitmen, Samuel L Jackson and Travolta and the witty dialogue.The story is basically disjointed and is told in non-linear fashion but they all make sense in the end. You would be wondering why Travolta gets shot death in the middle of the show but reappears later.It starts with two novice robbers chitchatting and decide to rob a diner. When they (one of them is Tim Roth of 'Lie to me') hold a gun to hold up, the credits roll in. The story stops there and continues at the tail end of the movie. But then the tail end is not sequentially the end of the story as the end is told in the middle! New concept, a breakthrough that was earth shattering and earned many accolades.Vincent (Travolta) and Jules (Jackson) are hitmen for Wallace. They are mean killers who collect some merchandise from double crossers. Then there is a scene where Vincent has to baby-sit Wallace's wife, Mia (Uma Thurman). She overdoses herself with heroin and creates a heart stopping scene for Vincent.Another plot is the story of Butch, a boxer, who is suppose to lose a fight on Wallace's orders but defeats his opponent instead! The mob is hot on his heels while he makes a dash. He has, however, to return to his apartment to retrieve an old wrist which he inherited from his great grandfather! Vincent is waiting for him there but is shot by Butch instead.In a twist, Wallace and Butch get entangled with a shop owner who apprehend them.In another scene, Wallace accidentally shoots a victim and calls upon Jimmie (Tarantino) to clear up his mess.The scene finally returns to the diner where the two robbers are. Coincidentally, Vincent and Jules are there. Because of what Jules perceived as a miracle and a message from God, he gives his money to the robber and leaves his profession.An entertaining flick..."

'Pulp Fiction''; there is nothing that has not been said about it. The film was released during the same year and lost the academy award for best picture to 'Forest Gump'.'Pulp Fiction' is a black comedy which focuses on several people who have a sort of affiliation with the man Marsellus Wallace (a mob boss of sorts). The two central characters of Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield are hit-men who work for Wallace (though I would say that they're actually paid to do whatever random chore is asked of them). The film is divided into several chapters (none of which are shown chronologically) and these chapters all depict a period of three or so days. The prologue is of the first day, and the first chapter is of the first day also (some time earlier); the second chapter is of after the prologue, and the third chapter is of the second two days; the fourth chapter is of the time between the prologue and the first chapter. Most every bit of these chapters are full with black comedy; I did not know this all when I first watched the movie, and so I was pleasantly shocked to find that the (very un-over-the-top) deaths and detailed speeches caused for me to laugh some.I'm not going to say much because whoever is reading this and has never seen the full movie should; I won't spoil anything for you. 10/10"

Amazing acting, direction, and the dialogue is the best in any film I've ever seen. But what I'm posting the comment about, is what is in the briefcase that Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) is willing to risk his life to protect. There are many theories, but here is my favourite: Marcellus Wallace (the big black guy) has a plaster on the back of his head. This is because he has had his soul removed and he has sold it to the Devil. The soul is in the briefcase (the code for which is 666). The guys who eat the Tasty Kahuna Burgers are Hell's Angels, transporting the soul in the briefcase to the Devil. Jules and Vincent (Jackson and Travolta) are angels, and are out to intercept the soul and return it to Marcellus Wallace. The theory is more intricate, and I do not know where Bruce Willis and Harvey Keitel etc. fit in, but that is the bare bones. I advise you to watch the film again, bearing this in mind."

First you have two hit men who are on patrol to retrieve a stolen briefcase (who run into a few mishaps along the search).

6,9-May-14,launsbachc,0,0,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"Mind Boggling","Pulp Fiction in my opinion is one of the greatest movies of all time. Whenever I watch a movie that keeps me thinking about meaning for weeks, I know its a good one. I have watched it several times and really attempted to embrace all the aspects of the film. What is most noticeable and significant about the film is its extremely unorthodox presentation of the story. Different parts of the plot are shown out of order during the screen duration. There are essentially three different stories being told that are all in some way connected. Furthermore, there is such a vast amount of symbolism, indirect implications, and metaphors the meaning of the film is very ambiguous. To try review all the different thoughts I have regarding the films significance and meaning would take several pages. In a basic sense I think there is a lot of redemption going on in the film. Jules redeems himself by not killing the restaurant their, Butch redeems himself by saving Marsellus, and Marsellus redeems himself by allowing Butch to live and escape L.A. like he planned. Note that all these characters are alive when we pursue the plot duration is over. Vincent is a key character behind the theory the movie could be about redemption. At no point in the film does Vincent indicate he wishes to make more constructive or morally conscious decisions. We know that Vincent is later killed when he is sent to assassinate Butch. Perhaps his lack of enlightenment is the reason his character does not live and the other who make decisions that defy there stereotypical self remain alive. Regardless the most significant aspect of the film is the fact the meaning is so ambiguous and the story is told in such a scrambled manner."

Holding a gun in one hand and a suitcase in the other, he repeatedly berates and interrogates his victim. The victim stutters in response. "English, motherf*cker, do you speak it?" Jules yells again. Vincent (the character played by John Travolta) rests easily on the wall as if this was nothing new to him. Before inevitably killing the poor man, he lashes out another series of vulgar yet shockingly hilarious slur of swears, punch lines, and bible quotes before pulling out his gun and shooting him to death. These quotes are not merely for shock value, and they are spoken in the climax of the movie. They appear within the first 20 minutes of the movie, and are some of the most quotable lines in movie history.This movie isn't intended for children. If the R-rated warning didn't already give that much away. The movie contains many instances of drug use and profanity. Although it is a movie about hit-men and the drug business, the central themes of the movie do not completely center around it. There is a deeper meaning to the movie itself. Not just every violent, gangster drug related movie can make it to top-ten movie lists (IMDB rates it number 5). While this movie is for adults, it's also for the more intellectual audience. Morons will be attracted to the movie through its violence and profanity, but intelligent people will walk away with much more. The time line of the movie itself is jumbled and isn't portrayed in the way everything happened, and that alone takes time to figure out. The symbolism of Bruce Willis's struggle to get his golden watch is not many will pick up on. Not to mention the symbolic right vs. wrong roles played by Jules and Vincent that inevitably lead to their separate fates. The characters, despite their rash language and dangerous professions all have redeeming qualities and are constructed individually and interestingly. Samuel Jackson, or "Jules" is more or less the main character who travels around with his companion Vincent doing various tasks for Marsellus Wallace(Played by Ving Rhames). Though all characters carry the same profession, all of them are different in their morals, attitudes, and composure. It doesn't come up until later in the movie, but what separates Jules and Vincent are their decisions whether to stay in the business or leave. This ultimately leads to Vincents death as he chooses to continue his involvement with Marsellus. Jules, being the more superstitious of the two, reaches a "moment" of clarity early in the time line of the story which enacts him to change his ways as he believes that a "higher power" is telling him to quit. Vincent and Jules contrast with each other, which in turn makes them the perfect combination. Vincent, more reserved. Jules, more sporadic. Vincent, a heroin addict. Jules, a clean man. Vincent, calm, cool and collected. Jules, loud and controlling. All characters intertwine themselves and hold various attitudes to each other that amount to gore, violence, death, and even rape. No character is looked down up on.The movie itself carries many references to pop culture and the movie is constructed around such. Vincent keeps his hair long and in a pony tail and Jules keeps his in a jerry curl – two styles relevant to earlier times (not to mention these hair styles somewhat reflect their characters). The movie for the most part is fairly present, if not a decade earlier than the year it was produced (1994). The music is mostly older music – from the 1960s and 1970s – and no real original score exists as any music played is from these periods in time. At one point in the movie, Vincent takes Marsellus's wife on a date (not a real date, just "good company" as he puts it) to a 1950's diner where many famous celebrities can be pointed out, such as Elvis and Marilyn Monroe. The music is mostly American rock music, and it is fitting to a story that is very much American."

Tarantino's work is told in a series of flashbacks that are not in chronological order, which causes some confusion, but not enough to ruin the experience of the film. The story is interesting in that it follows the "bad guys", a group of men who work for a mob boss named Marcellus Wallace. The film is also divided into sub parts, which are indicated by a break in the filming. These sub parts tell the individual stories of those who are connected to Wallace and how they connect to one another. The acting throughout the film is also top notch. While Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta play the most prominent roles in the film; some of the best acting comes from the side characters in the film such as Uma Thurman. I would highly recommend this film to all movie lovers, as it combines several film elements such as violence and comedy and ties them together in unconventional ways."

Other then it being my favorite movie i can not begin to describe how much i like it. I am only 14 but i got everything about this movie. QT is a outstanding movie director, deff top 10 of the best directors in the world. WARNING SPOILERS: This movie revolves on different stories, all leading up to one big story in different orders, meaning that this movie isn't in order, but if you have a brain you will get it. A boat load of good actors, Sam Jackson, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, Ving Rhimes, John Travolta, Rosanna Arquette, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, and even QT himself. Sam Jackson and John Travolta play two gangsters on their way to deliver a case of ? something? it is never explained to their boss Ving Rhimes. Bruce Willis plays a Boxer who disobeys Ving Rhimes orders and is on the run. Uma Thurman plays a Ving Rhimes wife. Rosanna Arquette plays a drug dealers wife. Amanda Plummer and Tim Roth play husband and wife in the Restaurant Take-Over scene. This movie is noted for its extreme violence which deff takes its toll in this movie as many people are shot, a man is a raped, and car crashes, and a scene of OD. I will explain some of the my favorite stories. I like the Bonnie Situation in which John travolta shoots a gangmember in the face in his car on accident and Harvey Keitel comes to help them solve the problem. I also Like the Ving Rhimes and Bruce Willis stand off in rednecks store. I could go on and on but i cant, so just see this movie. I also want to comment on the music which is outstanding, and the direction, QT's long shots are very realistic."

Here's how it came to me, first of all, on an unrelated note, I once heard that anyone who sees a soul dies soon after. Now regarding the movie, we never see whats in the briefcase, but it shines so it could be gold, but I reckon someone would have pointed it out and said, "wow, that gold is amazing!" Marcellus Wallace has a plaster or bandaid on the back of his neck through out the film and he wants the contents of the briefcase quite badly. Now, to prove my point, the following saw the contents of the briefcase and died: Vincent Vega and all the guys that him and Jules took it from on their 'errand'. Tim Roths character also saw it, BUT!.. his soul was bought off of him by Jules in the restaurant for $1500; "go on take it, but I'm buying something with that money. You know what I'm buying, your soul". Jules himself took the Kung Fu-esque wiseman route to do good, so Tim Roths character gets to live... as for Jules himself, he never actually looked into it..."

His directing is so realistic that he is able to make even a fantasy movie look so real. PULP FICTION is not an exception from the rule.The most delicious part of this masterpiece is not the action, but the memorable dialogs. You'll never forget the lines of JULES (Samuel L. Jackson) including the Ezekiel 25:17 quote, the DEAD N. STORAGE joke (Quentin Tarantino), or the intelligent lines of MIA (Uma Thurman).The interesting issue about this movie is that, like in all the other Taranantino movies, the action is unpredictable. I'm sure nobody expected that VINCENT (John Travolta) would be killed, specially because he was the main wiseguy besides JULES. Also the case for MARSELLUS (Ving Rhames), the boss who got raped.Because of these you'll have your breath taken away for the whole 2 1/2 hours of the movie, and when you'll see the closing credits you'll be very disappointed that it's over.Definitely 10 out of 10 for the directing and the acting."

Each major charachter has a significant portion of the limelight to get quite a detailed story behind them, even the sub characters have a story, *spoiler* such as the bar tender who we later see is now working with Vincent as jules' replacement, the two of them are in search of a boxer who has ripped off their boss but goes on to save him later, after the boxer has killed vincent, but vincent had earlier witnessed what jules (his old partner) saw as a miracle but chose to ignore it.This is by no means anywhere near the entire plot of this movie, and we already have more plot than the first two installments of lotr. To complicate and add even more suspense in not knowing whats happening and removing any chance of predictability in the long term, the film is cut up and rearranged with bits overlapping imperfectly to show different perceptions of an event."

I read some of the info on IMDb before seeing it, I remember that it seemed to contain more goofs than any other film that I have looked up on IMDb.  What little I knew about the film made me biased.  I, of course watched it carefully and analytically yet I still didn't pick up on any of the little nuances.  Where are all these alleged clocks that say the time is four-twenty???  Who made up that up??? I guess I'm not quick enough to appreciate Tarantino's commitment to detail. The only thing I was able to question was that the background in the cab scene was pretty chintsy but I thought that it was deliberate to give it a 1940's film-noir kinda feel.It's mildly funny and quite philosophical.Even after seeing it, I still feel like I have not seen it yet!  Does anyone know where I can get a "real" version of the film?  It was not what I expected.  I guess ANY slight knowledge of this particular film is an ultimate spoiler.  I didn't see how Uma Thurman's character had to do with the whole thing.  I would have edited her out completely, yet she was the movie's marketing image.   However, I think the cast and acting was bar-none.  Overall a great experimental attempt and a stepping stone of films that followed.  At least I know why my friends have changed since 1994 in their speech and attitude.  This could have been an interesting blaxploitation film if it had been released circa 1976.  I would say the movie is like (Deliverance) meets (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels)I don't see what the big fuss over this movie was, though it did have an personal impact on me.  Makes me think everyone around me has a gun."

The constant violence may not appeal to everyone, but it is necessary to give you an in-depth look at what life in gangland is really like.It's a movie full of ingenuity and has something that directly grips viewer's thought. It is a movie which includes elements that challenges the boundary of conventional film making. The film has amazing structure and screenplay. Witty and zany dialog pervade this tumultuous film of violence and decadence. The characters are all incredible and each role is filled with a great actor who obviously relishes the chance to perform in this movie."

His conversion at the end of the movie I think is the triumph of character and virtue over shallowness. He quits killing and decides to "wander the earth" as so many people of conviction have done(the Disciples of Christ as well as many other historical/religious figures.Moreover, this film is about protecting the dignity of people. While most of the characters are despicable, somehow they manage to save someone else in the film. Examples: When the junkie save Marcellus' wife Mia; Butch saving Marcellus from further harm.In the end, Pulp fiction forces you to discern the difference between fact and fiction."

The first time I saw it I was 16 and I had never really seen a movie that contained an artistic sentiment to it. Up to that point my favorite movies were ones like Wayne's World, or Young Frankenstein. Then I found the Pulp Fiction VHS in a thrift store and thought I would give it a whirl. "Zeds dead baby, Zeds dead". That is the true end of the movie. It would probably take me watching it five times to finally realize that though. For the first time in my life I was watching a movie that contained critical thinking. It wasn't linear, and not only that but everything was so intense! But we all know about the movie. I think the greatest thing about this film isn't necessarily the placement of scenes etc, but instead the mystery element revolving around it.My main focus when looking back to the movie is figuring out what was in the briefcase. Was it Wallace's soul? What happened when Samuel L Jackson and John Travolta killed the guys in the apartment and light started flashing?Tarantino made a world full of questions. A parallel universe that, despite close to ours, isn't. That is the genius behind this film and I recommend those who have seen it once or twice to go back and what it again... see what else you find."

This movie is perfect in all the senses, from the top to the bottom, the script is impeccable, in my opinion it doesn't have any failure. The time as the movie develops is a little bit confusing because of the jumps in time in all the sequences but is understandable. All the movie is a piece of history, all the characters are immoral and all of them got an essence, that make them special. The movie is violent and raw, but also it got a comedy touch in The Wolf scene for example. It is simply amazing movie, and in my opinion a movie that you got to see before you die. And as a warning, this movie doesn't have any message, the script is a little bit bulgar, there are hard images, a lot of violence, so if you are looking for a soft movie, this is not your movie. But if you don't have any trouble with that you must, and I repeat, you must see this movie."

Spoilers!","There is spoilers.Pulp Fiction (1994) has multiple characters that show that even in this big bad world that we live in that there are still people that will help us when we are need. The main characters lives that are followed throughout the film are all intertwined with the crime boss. There is the crime boss, Marsellus Wallace played by Ving Rhames,that puts a hit out on a prize fighter Butch Coolidge, played by Bruce Willis. They get themselves into a situation when trying to kill each other and Butch gets free and about leaves but turns around to help Marsellus out of the situation as well. Then you have Marsellus's two criminals, Jules Winnfield played by Samuel L. Jackson and Vincent Vega played by John Travolta, that go around killing people that are behind on paying Marsellus his money or has done Marsellus wrong. Vincent ends up helping Marsellus's wife, Mia Wallace played by Uma Thurman, when she overdoses on drugs. Then, we have Jules who does not kill the couple that is trying to rob everyone in the restaurant, including trying to take his boss's briefcase. These so called "bad guys" are not really bad, they just do bad things and do help a person out when help is needed.This film portrays these so called "bad guys" by using low-angle camera shots. As these "bad guys" help those in need, they are shown in high-angle or regular straight angle shots portraying that they are no longer "bad guys." Another technique that is used throughout the film is fade-out/fade-in transitions. These are used to transition to another scene or just to show that time has passed. For example, when Vincent and Mia were at Jack Rabbit Slims to eat and then it fades-out and fades-in when they are at Mia's residence.Another film that shows that "bad guys" are really not that bad and people helping others is The Green Mile (1999). This film shows that the "bad guys" are human beings as well and that they only did bad things, but are not bad people. The "bad guys" in this film also help others and show compassion towards others, including a mouse.If you can look past the bad things that are happening to these characters and see the good in it, this is a movie that you would love to see. This is by far one of the best movies I have seen."

Wood Jr., proclaimed the Worst Director of All Time, he's in love with every shot - intoxicated with the very act of making a movie. It's that very lack of caution and introspection that makes "Pulp Fiction" crackle like an ozone generator: Here's a director who's been let loose inside the toy store, and wants to play all night."

It is both a joy and a trial to sit through.  Amazingly original and unforgettable, Quentin Tarantino's trash masterpiece never gets old or seem outdated.  It put a face on American independent film making in 1994. Miramax had been around since the 1970s and no one had heard of it before this film.  Studios went into a panic when this film came out because they knew it would be an amazing hit.  Of course it was.  Independent film making became the rage and hit its peak in 1996 when four of the five nominated Best Picture films were from independent studios.  The screenplay and direction by Tarantino are quite amazing, but the cast makes the film work. John Travolta (Oscar nominated) re-invented his career with this film. Bruce Willis cemented his celebrity.  Samuel L. Jackson and Uma Thurman (both Oscar nominees) became marketable superstars.  Others who make appearances include: Ving Rhames, Christopher Walken, Eric Stoltz, Rosanna Arquette, Steve Buscemi, Frank Whaley, Harvey Keitel, and of course Quentin Tarantino himself.  They all leave lasting impressions as well.  Samuel L. Jackson stood out the most to me, his lack of substantial screen time may have cost him the Oscar.  Just an amazing accomplishment, all involved deserve recognition.  Easily 5 stars out of 5."

6,18-Apr-04,Gatorman9,269,496,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"Awesome!","I just finished screening this movie for the first time after putting it off for a number of years because of what seemed like equivocating appraisals from some of my friends. In hindsight, however, it seems to me that while the movie must have definitely bowled them over, overall they weren't sure exactly what to make of it or how to articulate what were probably a confused mix of feelings. But I am so impressed that I feel compelled to add a few specific observations to the many fine reviews already on this database.First, this movie hits you with an impact somewhere in between, say, APOCALYPSE NOW and A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, and for some people may be just as disturbing (however, in this respect I am happy to report I didn't think it rose to the level of NATURAL BORN KILLERS). Full of graphically violent action and language, PULP FICTION is not a picture for everyone - I would definitely not recommend it to my parents, born in the 1930's (even to my one fairly "hip" relative of the same generation who, at age 66, still teaches high school sex education and likes to talk about things like sunbathing nude, among other potentially sensitive issues).Irrespective of audience sensibilities, however, the film-makers, supported by superb acting in every role, manage to create a world full of the most fascinating sleazy characters possibly ever to appear on screen. From Travolta's pronounced almost-child-like curiosity about the world to Jackson's sincere and thoughtful philosophical ruminating and Willis's deep devotion to the memory of his father, I think such fascination lies not only in the characters' personalities as they are portrayed but in the way they tantalize the viewer into considering the possibility that such people could actually exist. As a lawyer of some years' experience dealing with all sorts of people I was particularly drawn to this aspect of the film.Thus, and in response to some other reviewers' comments, I think this movie is more character-driven than plot-driven. Instead of a story peopled by basically weakly developed characters employed primarily as a mere device to move the plot along, as is too frequently the case in the movies (especially these days), the undeniably strong, clever, and unpredictable plot lines in PULP FICTION are actually of essentially secondary interest and importance, serving primarily as vehicles to get you worried about the fate of characters you can't help caring about despite the truly low attributes that otherwise form the basis for their respective personas. As at least one other reviewer noted, when the film ends you are actually disappointed, left craving more of these crazy people and their explosive lives.Finally, and as strange as it may sound, this film reminds me of another Monumentally Great Film which one would never typically associate with it in any way in a million years - CASABLANCA. As in that film made way back in 1942, and as another reviewer has suggested, perhaps its special appeal - its unusually high degree of emotional impact - lies in its distinctly successful simultaneous application of several different genres in a single film - drama, action, dark humor - with the whole thing bound together by essentially flawless execution in every department. And while CASABLANCA is no doubt clearly much more wholesome and high-minded, like the older film PULP FICTION is not without a pronounced theme of redemption, even if it is not as strongly felt, considering all the later film's sleaze and violence.In sum, when people say that this is probably the best film of the 1990's, it is easy to see why. Fundamentally a truly outstanding movie, it is a must-see for anyone who considers themself a film buff and can handle graphic subject matter.(Incidentally, if you would like a more toned-down, much more overtly humorous and less serious picture with a not-altogether dissimilar look and feel, don't miss another 1990's Travolta picture, GET SHORTY.)"

A masterpiece","Tarantino is without a doubt one of the best directors of all time and maybe the best of the 90's. His first film, Reservoir Dogs was amazing and claustrophobic, his segment in Four Rooms was by far the greatest (even though Rodriguez's was excellent too)and Jackie Brown is a wonderful homage to the Blaxploitation films of the 70's. However, Pulp Fiction remains my favourite.It was nominated for so many Oscars that I still find it hard to believe that it only got one: Best original script. I'm not complaining because Forrest Gump got best picture, since that film was also Oscar-worthy, but come on, movies like Tarantino's or the Shawshank Redemption deserved much more.Anyway, going back to the movie, I particularly liked the first and second chapters, and that's really a contradiction because one of the movie's finest characters, Mr. Wolf, appears on the third. Bruce Willis also does a great job, and as far as I'm concerned he fell in love with the movie right after having read the script. I like the way his character gives a "tough guy" image at the beginning and then we discover he's so affectionate and tender to his wife. Travolta is obviously the star of the movie and his second encounter with Bruce Willis in the kitchen along with the scene where he dances with Uma Thurman is when the movie reaches it's highest point.The other star is Samuel L. Jackson, who plays a wise assassin that obviously knows how to handle situations. "And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger..." is my favourite quote.Summarizing, Pulp Fiction is a modern classic and a must-see for anyone who is at least aware of what a movie is. I give it a 9 out of 10."

Sign in to vote.,"Classic Pulpy Amusement","It's no surprise that 'Pulp fiction' is a movie that made cinematic history and defined the pulp fiction genre. It features a series of conversations and events coherently, but not chronologically, told. Tarantino tells three different but intertwined stories. Each of the stories are clichéd and have a noir feel but Tarantino gives them a different and unique treatment and adds sharp witty dialogues full of truth and irony (and references to many classic movies and popular TV shows). He uses a lot of warm colours and the film is slightly sepia tinted. Also there's a lot of attention to intricate detail and it is a finely layered movie such that one discovers something new with every subsequent viewing. There's also a certain ambiguity about it. It's not certain in which time the film is set or what was it in the briefcase that stunned Ringo...lots of questions and the answers are open for discussion. The cinematography is slick and sharp and the soundtrack is a classic. Then there's the outstanding cast that includes, John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Tim Roth, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, Rosanne Arquette, Eric Stoltz, Ving Rhames, Maria de Medeires and Amanda Plummer, all of whom have a magnificent presence and memorable dialogue delivery. There are so many classic scenes that people discuss, even today. My personal favourites are the date sequence (and the scenes that follow) with Travolta and Thurman and the series of conversations between Travolta and Jackson. I doubt there's anything to say about 'Pulp Fiction' that hasn't been said. Whether one likes it or not, this movie is here to stay and even today it is among the most talked about movies. I have already seen it at least four times and it still amuses and fascinates me just like it did during first viewing."

Sign in to vote.,"Energetic and imaginative - making up for it's lack of real heart with a great wealth of dialogue and characters","Pumpkin and Honey Bunny are thieves who plan their next job whilst drinking coffee in a diner.  Jules and Vincent are hitmen in the employment of top man Marsellus Wallace who must retrieve a stolen suitcase for him.  Butch is a boxer near the end of his career who is ordered to take a dive by Wallace. Mia Wallace is Marsellus' wife who Vincent must show a good time while her husband is out of town.  In a flurry of violence, double crosses and accidents their stories collide in their world of murder, theft and drugs.It is perhaps easier to view this film now than it was when it first came out in the cinema.  At that time the TV schedules were full of interviews with Tarantino and lots of hype.  While it is still considered one of the best films of the 1990's, it is easier to watch it with a fresh eye now. The best film about the film is just how striking each part of it is.  The plot is well constructed in a weave of stories that all stand up well on their own but support other strands.  Often films that jump around within time will be hard to follow but here Tarantino does a great job of not only avoiding this but actually using his structure to propel the film forwards to good effect.The stories are never dull and, although some are better than others, they all pretty much stand up well.  The dialogue in the film could have been annoyingly inane - indeed at points I did tire of the constant pop culture references, but it mostly manages to engage and add to the characters.  It is consistently witty but open to sudden moments of action or violence that are all the more shocking for their suddenness.  There is a point where the film could have been better in the area of emotional involvement.  Most of the violence is met with laughter or interest by the audience rather than real shock or loss; the reason for this is simply that we don't ever really care about the characters on that emotional level - they are players rather than friends.  This is not a major problem as it is something that the pulp genre is happy without and in fairness Tarantino never pretends he is trying to do that.The only other problem with the film is it's glamorisation of both drugs and crime.  This would be a bit of a problem if I wasn't aware of the type of film it was, but I was and I just accepted it; like the man himself said `you don't go to a Metallica gig and tell the f**kers to turn the volume down', so too you don't watch this film expecting it to be anything other than darkly funny, violent and so on.The cast are very good in their various roles; nobody plays it totally straight and they all seem aware that they aren't playing this story in the real world but in a trashy world of pulp fiction hitmen, gangsters and their molls and so on.  Travolta is very good, it's easy to forget now that he had been in the wilderness before this film.  He gives a good performance and manages to make his character likeable without making him pleasant. Jackson impresses more in support and he deserved to win the Oscar that alluded him (`sh*t' he was seen to mouth in place of the usual `oh well done' fake smile!).  His character drive the main part of the film well and is enjoyable.  Willis actually acts here and does well despite not having that much of a range to deliver across.  Thurman is much better here than in Kill Bill and she brings her character to life reasonably well.  Rhames is imposing in his small role and the rest of the cast includes actors such as Whaley, Arquette (times two!), Stoltz, Gallagher, Buscemi, Walken, Greene and a wonderfully enjoyable turn by Keitel.  Tarantino makes a cameo himself and reminds the world why we prefer him not to act, but in fairness he is not as bad as he can be.Overall this is a great film.  It may be a little soulless and cruel if you are not expecting it to be a film that lives up to it's title and is `pulp fiction' but if you know what to expect then you will enjoy it a great deal. The interweaving stories and witty dialogue all keep the film moving forward and, while not a serious or worthy film in any way, it has a great narrative to it and is exciting and enjoyable."

6,19-Aug-11,Michael_Elliott,12,25,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"Masterpiece of Characters and Dialogue","Pulp Fiction (1994) **** (out of 4) Quentin Tarantino's breakthrough about the underside of the L.A. crime scene and focuses on stories involving a couple hit men (John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson), a down and out boxer (Bruce Willis) and the big man's wife (Uma Thurman). Over the course of a matter of days their lives all get connected in this roller coaster ride of a movie. If you're looking for warmth or heart then it's best you stay away from this movie but if you want a brilliantly constructed story dealing with people who often don't get movies made about them then PULP FICTION is just for you. Yes, crime movies have always featured these type of violent men and women but no screenplay has ever gotten inside their head or tried to show what killers talk about while they're on the job. The dialogue is what really seals the deal on this film and it certainly deserved the Best Screenplay Oscar that it won. The stories are told out of order, which is always a tough way to tell a story because you can often confuse the viewer or make it so frustrating that the viewer just gives up. Tarantino's stories are so well structured that you never get confused as to what's going on and being able to see how some characters end up before we get to the actual ending, which in fact takes place earlier than the "real" ending works very well. There are so many classic scenes to be found in this movie but some of the highlights include a terrific dance sequence between Travolta and Thurman to a Chuck Berry classic, an adrenaline shot sequence and of course the classic Biblical quote delivered by Jackson. As great as the screenplay is it offered many people a jump to their career and this was certainly true for Travolta who really gets to shine here. When this movie was released it was considered his first great film in years and it gave that career and major boost but it's a shame he hasn't done more with it over the years. Jackson became known as that "Bad Motherf&*&er," which perfectly sums up his performance. Both Thurman and Willis do a great job with their roles and the supporting players are all extremely good as well. PULP FICTION truly is a cult classic that delivers on the suspense, the laughs and it really just makes you feel as if you're looking in on a group of people who you'd normally never be in the same room with. Add the great soundtrack, the wonderful cinematography and some terrific homages to older movies and you've really got something original and special. Tarantino's influence of the crime flicks from the 70s and the Europeon crime films is so apparent yet he takes these moments and makes them his own. PULP FICTION really did change the way movies were made and it was a real eye-opener when it was first released but like most masterpieces it also keeps getting better with age."

Sign in to vote.,"Hands down, the best film of the '90s.","Pulp Fiction, despite borrowing from just about every movie ever made, is the most invigorating cinema experience a filmgoer can ever hope for. Its hodgepodge of violence, mayhem, and generally deviant behavior is an assault on the senses, not to mention political correctness. However, despite all the film's cleverness and style, it hinges on the performance put forth by Samuel L. Jackson as Jules. The fact that he was denied an Oscar is a downright shame. Martin Landau, the best supporting actor winner that year, was terrific and funny in Ed Wood, but Jackson was perhaps the most commanding screen presence in film history as the bible-quoting, godfearing hitman. The last scene in the coffee shop with Tim Roth still sends chills down my spine, no matter how many times I've seen it. Rumors of a prequel involving Jules and Vincent (John Travolta) have been floating around lately. If Quentin Tarantino wishes to regain the fans he lost with the dissapointing (but still pretty good) Jackie Brown, he should get to work right away. I'll be the first in line to see the finished product."

It is the REAL DEAL.","Ill go on record and claim that Pulp Fiction is probably the best motion picture Ive ever seen. After you have seen Pulp Fiction, things are just different, whether you like it or not. Other films seem empty, boring, un-creative, formulaic, and bland compared to this monster. What happened with Pulp Fiction is more or less a pop culture phenomenon. This film single-handedly set the blueprint for every other film that followed it. Everything from high budget epics to teen romances draw on aspects of this flick. Some incredible things came with Pulp Fiction, and almost 10 years later it is still sending tremors throughout the motion picture industry. Compelling and comedic dialogue, brilliant editing, top notch acting, bravado directing - this film encapsulates everything good, fun and clever about the filmmaking process and audience interaction with a film. Tarantino gets career high performances from John Travolta, Sam Jackson and Uma Thurman. You put these people under any other director and look what happens...not a whole lot. What happened with this movie was nothing short of pure genius on all counts. What you get here is a collection of entertainment, shock and disbelief. All of these things swarm into your mind as you watch this, and surrendering to them is enjoyable. How many movies could you just listen to? Ive had this movie on in another room as I did other things, and it was still pretty entertaining. The dialogue is obviously what sent this movie over the top, and with good reason - it is quite simply incredible. Its hard to summarize my thoughts coherantly on this one...It is THAT good. If you havent seen this, rent it, watch it and enjoy it. Its one hell of a ride.***** out of ******"

6,15-May-05,eastcoastguyz,40,95,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"Too long, too boring with poor story development","It seems that Quentin Tarantino must have written this movie, by writing down some gross scenes he wants to play out and then almost as a jump-cut tries to string those scenes together. It doesn't work, what does work are the big stars in the movie to bring people to watch it. They think, a collection of stars, so it must be a great movie. Sometimes it is, but this one isn't.The dance scene was nothing special. People continue to believe that John Travolta is actually a dancer because of the movie Saturday Night Fever. He "played" a dance, which isn't the same as being a dancer. He looked overweight and stiff in the dance scene of this movie, although this scene was promoted heavy when the movie first name out. Quentin Tarantino must have thought, that since Travolta played a dancer in another movie, we should have him dance. While Christopher Walken who in addition to being a fine actor is also a real dancer, doesn't dance in this film, which is a shame. While Travolta was great in Get Shorty, this script isn't a mature work. The story development is very poor, and has very long dragged scenes that add nothing to the story. It tries to conceal this fact by showing gross scenes which you get bored with seeing at the first sign of blood. The bad guys aren't just bad, they are stupid. If crime is your business, and you intend to kill someone, just kill them, no sense in lecturing them. It isn't like they are going to improve from this lecture. Maybe Quentin Tarantino wrote this script and then realized it didn't have enough gross stuff, so he put more of it in. The shock value doesn't last long. There are many characters in the story which could have developed into a wonderful story, showing the interplay and relationships between them all, which it could have easily done consider this bore is 2 and a half hours long, but they decided to go for the undergrad film school approach to long scenes which make you wish for a TV ad to break it up. Last and certainly not the least offensive of this movie, is how horrible music was used incorrectly. Nothing but songs tossed in which have nothing to do with anything. This shows he isn't a mature filmmaker who knows what the power of music can do for films. Quentin Tarantino needs to watch more Hitchcock films for starters. Tarantino needs to study characters since all those in this film were pretty much one dimensional. The people who claim this is a master piece don't know what a real master piece is. They have not studied films, they have not lived, and most of all, they don't really think for themselves. The marketing of this film tells them it is hip, so they look at it to be hip."

6,16-Dec-15,CinemaClown,4,7,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"Quentin Tarantino's Magnum Opus Is Cinematic History In The Making","Every once in a while, a film comes along that changes everything. Whenever the industry went out of ideas & employed the same formula for too long, there always emerged a new wave of films that injected new life into this medium and in the process ended up changing the way we are accustomed to watching & perceiving motion pictures. And Pulp Fiction is, without a doubt, one of those movies.Winner of the prestigious Palme d'Or at Cannes & Best Screenplay at Oscars, Pulp Fiction was a force to be reckoned with at its time of release for it opened many realms that were previously thought to be non-existent and in the long run, didn't just influence cinema but other media as well. Everything about it was different from the norm and it remains one of the most original & groundbreaking stories to ever unfold on the silver screen.Pulp Fiction intertwines three different story lines into one and is told in a nonlinear fashion. The first follows two hit men who are out to retrieve a mysterious suitcase which belongs to their boss. The second is about one of those two hit men who's put in charge of taking care of the boss' wife while he's out of town. And third concerns an aging but proud boxer who is asked to drop a fight in exchange for a handsome reward. The lives of these odd people collide in unexpected ways, resulting in some hilarious situations.Written & directed by Quentin Tarantino, his sophomore effort is even better than his debut feature which was a milestone in itself. Tarantino has injected the script with extensive pop culture references, a vast line-up of idiosyncratic characters & explosive dialogues plus the way this whole story is narrated and its wicked fusion of violence & humour turns it into an endlessly enjoyable, wildly entertaining & thoroughly refreshing ride that's in a league of its own.What's also amazing is the fact that most of the conversations taking place in the movie is not even related to the plot and is simply a casual discussion on a randomly chosen topic. And yet, without these wisecracking moments, Pulp Fiction wouldn't really be Pulp Fiction. The amount of focus that went into the smallest of details during the writing process is this film's biggest strength and when it comes to pure screenplay wizardry, Pulp Fiction has no equals & probably never will.The technical aspects are no slouch for the picture exhibits a number of new tricks when it comes to bringing the script to life on the film canvas. Cinematography presents Tarantino adding a few more photography techniques to his sleeve that would later become his own trademarks. Editing intentionally rearranges the order in which the events unfold and keeps the viewers on their toes at all times. And the soundtrack is a compilation of rock n roll, pop & surf music that are cleverly chosen and surprisingly fit the accompanying sequences.Two key elements that are highly contrasting in general but, in Tarantino's films, fit together as if co-dependent on each other is violence & humour. He's a rare artist who is capable of making us laugh uncontrollably at a scene that involves a person's head getting blown-off. Now there is substantial amount of violence in this picture but those violent sequences are also its funniest moments and the reason why it works so well is coz the addition of hilarity to such brutality significantly neutralizes the effect gore & violence alone may have had on the audience.Coming to the acting department, Pulp Fiction features a star-studded cast in John Travolta ,Samuel L Jackson, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, Christopher Walken, Ving Rhames, Bruce Willis, & many more, and is notable for launching & revitalising the careers of many. Travolta resurrects himself with a smashing performance in the role of Vincent Vega. Jackson not delivers his career-best work but ends up reincarnating himself for this is the movie that made Samuel L. Jackson what Samuel L. Jackson is today and he will forever be indebted to Tarantino for this.Both Travolta & Jackson play the two hit men and their chemistry just clicks. Thurman plays Mia Wallace and is absolutely electrifying in her given role. Marsellus Wallace is a character whose presence looms over the entire story even during his absence & Ving Rhames didn't disappoint in portraying him. Willis adds another feather to his acting range and does nicely in balancing the toughness of his boxer character with a soft spot for his wife. Keitel steals every moment he is in. Roth & Plummer also have their moments to shine, and each one of them succeeds in bringing these scripted characters to life in just the right dose.On an overall scale, with its surprisingly powerful combination of unconventional structure, stylish direction, remarkable screenplay, stellar performances, energetic pace, mesmerising soundtrack and Tarantino's patented mix of violence & humour, Pulp Fiction succeeds as a delicious piece of pop culture that thrills & amuses in a highly unusual manner and is rightly counted amongst the greatest movies ever made. Immortal for its contribution to cinema & pop culture, an unsurpassed milestone in independent filmmaking, and a landmark moment in cinema history that permanently engraved Tarantino's name in the annals of filmmaking, Pulp Fiction is essential viewing in every sense of the word. Multiple viewings advised."

Following is my personal take on the film.Many have praised this film for "interweaving 3 different stories." Ever watch the TV series "Northern Exposure?" Every episode consists of 3 different, interwoven stories, and done much better than Tarentino does here. What this film does well is poke fun at the gangster movies, and does it with very witty writing. I especially liked the way these sordid characters got into various "philosophical discussions", like why in France a quarter-pounder cannot be called that, because of the metric system. Or why Jackson's character would not eat pork, because it is a dirty animal.To really enjoy this film, you have to numb yourself to all the filthy language and the gratuitous violence. However, it is neither an innovative film nor one with lasting meaning. That is why I rate it 5 of 10, and only that high because of the clever screenplay and direction.That reflects my own preference in movies. I give my highest ratings to such films as "Longitude", "Nixon", "Apollo Thirteen", "Amistad" - films based on great true stories. Or just entertaining but inoffensive ones like "Raiders of the Lost Ark" and "The Matrix". Or thought-provoking ones such as "Shawshank Redemption", "American History X", "Lone Star", or "Good Will Hunting".I give low ratings to such films as "The Game", "The Usual Suspects" - films which on the surface seem to dazzle, but in final analysis simply try to fool us into thinking they are something special. I don't think "Pulp Fiction" exactly does this, but its fans have given it high praise that I'd bet even its creator would hesitate to do."

I'd continue on ranting about how bad the story is written but this film just isn't worth anymore time. Please if you're wanting to see a great crime film go watch Goodfellas(1990) and if you want to go see a good action film go watch the Hunted(2003).

But I really can't watch the whole thing repeatedly, like with some true classics. It certainly doesn't deserve to be ranked in the top 5, or even really the top 100.Both Reservoir Dogs and True Romance are better films, even just examining the Tarantino Ouvre. The Christopher Walken / Dennis Hopper scene (and the Pimp-fight scene) from True Romance alone blows this film away.In all, I think this is ultimately a case of the emperor not wearing any clothes. If you watch these three films in one weekend, you should clearly see that PF is the weak link of the bunch. Its success appears largely a product of buildup from the earlier films, along with the desire of people to appear hip and cool, both then and now."

It brought back Travolta's career. Look at the load of movies he pulled out in the 90's after this. And it put Samuel on the map for good. It also acknowledged other underrated great actors.This isn't my favorite movie and I would never have to see it again. It was very disturbing to watch but very real. This movie also went against Hollywood's usual conduct of restraint. This movie had no restraints.I can't even give a summation of the story, but I applaud Q. Taratino for his artistic merit. He is very innovative and different. This movie was based on content, originality and style. I personally thought his best work was True Romance, From Dusk till Dawn, and Resorvoir Dogs. The key is in the script writing. He focuses on real characters with real dialogue. Not the cheesy kind and isn't afraid to touch racial/social differences that may be offensive. I truly think he is one of a kind and Pulp Fiction proved that."

Yes there were some funny bits, particularly Christopher Walken and the thing about the watch.  Yes Mr. Tarantino coaxed some very good performances out of some fairly mediocre actors, and yes they were aided by one very capable actor (Samuel L. Jackson).  What I don't get is the way everyone seems so enamored of the dialog.  As I recall, it competed for an Oscar that year with Much Ado About Nothing, starring a guy named Denzel Washington, written by a guy named Bill Shakespeare, and the best line from this 154 min. glamorization of our baser instincts seems to be "What do they call a quarter-pounder with cheese?" !!!????? As for interleaving plots, I'm wondering if any of the folks so taken with this have ever seen anything made by Robert Altman?

This ground breaking movie, much like the ground breaking music of the Ramones, has been endlessly discussed, praised, damned, ripped off and copied so many times that you can easily lose sight of the fact that what you have here is a genuinely original, exciting and important work of art that when experienced for the umpteenth time STILL never fails to thrill and amuse. The many talentless punk bands who have recycled watered down and witless imitations of Da Brudders music haven't made 'Rocket To Russia' any less brilliant, only more so. The same thing goes with Quentin Tarantino's countless less talented followers. They just make you appreciate 'Reservoir Dogs' and 'Pulp Fiction' even more.This movie is one of the few I would describe as perfect. I honestly cannot fault a thing about it. The brilliant dialogue has become legendary, the elliptical structure of the script (though influenced by Kubrick's 'The Killing', and the experiments of the French New Wave) has been much imitated and will continue to do so, the fantastic group of actors, who range from has-beens (at the time) to cult favourites, are all uniformly excellent, and the soundtrack is one of the coolest and most eclectic ever assembled. In short, this is a modern classic, and required viewing for all movie buffs, especially 70s nuts like myself. 'Pulp Fiction' is as good as any movie you care to name. To (mis)quote Flavor Flav - "believe the hype!""

What makes this movie, and not Slumber Party Massacre the best, is that this movie provides insight on the life of hitmen.  Generally speaking, a day in the life of a hitman, not really there life.  From what I seen, it was a day in the life of Jules and Vincent. That's why this movie is so excellent.  It is just nothing anybody has ever seen, and the title warns you before you enter the theater, and also provides a definition of "pulp" before the movie starts.  The performances are amazing, providing an all star cast, throughout.  It's kinda hard who takes the cake.. Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta both provide amazing performances....Rossana Arqueete is great as a peircing junkie, Uma Thurman, well, watch it and youll see... and so on and so on.What is there not to like about this movie?  If your looking for a "gone With the Wind" you will not find it, this is a gritty, gutter movie, not afarid to let anything go, which is why Quentin Tarantino is my idol."

As I grew older and older I've come to realize that this masterpiece from the 90s aged like fine wine. It's easily one of the most rewatchable movies considering it's filled with an insane amount of quotables, great cinematography and most importantly, charming characters that will stand the test of time.I truly believe that this movie is a work of art, the way Tarentino handpicked the songlist for the soundtrack helped elevate every single scene of the movie to a whole new level.To cut this short, this movie is easily one of the best movies ever made, and my personal favorite movie and I urge anyone who hasn't seen it to give it a shot."

Sign in to vote.,"Crazyness all over the board","for starters I could kind of tell that this was a Quentin Tarantino movie because all his movies seem to be dramatic or I guess you could say realistic and bold. This is a harsh story about drugs, robberies, and just overall mischief. Vincent Vega played by John Travolta was involved in a robbery of a diner right as the movie began. Making himself seem like an upstanding young man he is also heavily involved with heroin and mob like activity. Things get strange when he is asked by his mobster boss, Marsellus Wallace, to escort his wife, Mrs. Mia Wallace, while he is out of town. It seems like a recipe for disaster however not in the way one would normally think. The two did not hook up but Mia was in a deadly situation when she mistook Vince's heroin for cocaine and snorted it and overdosing. When Vince finds her he takes her to Lance's house where he normally buys his drugs and gives Mia an adrenalin shot to her heart. That situation could have been messy if they had screwed up in any way. Overall I thought this was a good movie although sometimes hard to follow. The harsh truth to it all gives it the essence of a Quentin Tarantino film."

Sign in to vote.,"The most over rated film of all time. 225 people here have commonsense.","Try this experiment : Ask any tarhead or Pulp fiction fan one thing about this movie, and the first thing they will reply offhand is the incredible number of f words (271) found in this, and of that being the largest amount in any movie in history. So it may not seem unreasonable to conclude that this movie's incredible popularity stems from preteens and teenagers who think that the f word is cool and hip. Doesn't paint moviegoers in the best light does it? While I liked Reservoir dogs and Kill Bill 1 and 2, I simply cannot understand how this movie was voted into the top 10 or maintains such a huge fanbase? Dogs and Kill Bill were both groundbreaking and Tarantino flicks themselves may be a kind of acquired taste but there is enough offensive material in this movie, totally wanton, to put anyone off. Overall it is nothing special and outstanding.Now since some of his other movies were really good, Tarantino must have obviously done something right in Pulp fiction. So what could have possibly been that makes this movie so popular? Realism - Like all his other movies, this movie is very realistic. But there aren't enough outstanding scenes where realism adds an extra touch. There are only scenes of violence, extreme and explicit drug abuse, sodomy and boring conversation. The open use of racism can be considered realism but it is simply so easy to implement if one wants to.Dialog - Mostly long and highly trivial. French McDonalds, killing people, coffee...wtf? You can only make something great out of it only if you overanalyse the dialog and then put your self in a delusion of being a great analyst or philosopher. Too many f words, n words and racist lines. This is not cool, kids. Its garbage. Or I guess that a lot of people converse on trivial lines and it is uplifting for them to see the same type of boring talk in a big movie? Acting - Pretty good but once again, there are too often uttering long and trivial dialog. None of the characters are likable or even dispiseable to the extent that they have such depth. They were all pretty shallow.Plot - Mostly nonexistent. You could probably extract a story of redemption from it but too many people put all sorts of philosophical angles which were simply not intended. A bunch of different chapters intersect at one point. Harvey Kietel's character is pointless and is just thrown in as a deus ex machina. Tarantino's character and dialog are also pointless.Actions scenes, special effects, twists and all that - None. Most scenes are well done but they simply boring. A simple scene well done but nothing special happening in it.One teenager probably goes and tells another teenager how cool this movie is for nothing other than its explicit use of offensive elements (drugs, violence, sodomy, bad language) and he tells his friend and so on, the chain reaction makes less than mature minds fall for this movie. When someone speaks out against how bad this movie really is, they are labelled as idiots so are afraid to speak their mind. I'm glad that 225 reviews here were at least accurate. Screw the peer pressure and speak your mind, kids.Sorry, this anti-movie just leaves more of a negative impression than any positive. It also drags too much. Its quite revolting although some scenes are quite memorable."

Jackson, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis, Harvey Keitel, Christopher Walken, Eric Stoltz, Ving Rhames, Rosanna Arquette, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, Peter Greene,Frank Whaley, Julia Sweeney, Quentin Tarantino.  Propolsive in-your-face salute to film noir with a Nineties slant with savvy filmmaking from auteur Tarantino interweaving three tales of crime, sex, greed and O. Henry sensibility mixed with Murphy's Law.  Outstanding in every sense with memorable performances by all particularly dim-witted hit man Travolta (Best Actor nominee in his second comeback) and Bible-verse speaking partner Jackson (Best Supporting Actor nominee) and a beefed up and nervy turn by Willis.  Wickedly clever and outrageously funny with some truly surprising moments of unease, carefully handled violence and arguably cinema's  worst blind date ever with kudos to an adrenaline enhanced kitschy Thurman (Best Supporting Actress nominee).  Winner of The Palmme d'Orr at Cannes and Oscar winner for Tarantino (also nominated for directing and Best Picture) for Best Original Screenplay with Roger Avary.  One of the decade's best."

Sign in to vote.,"Tribute to On the Waterfront","I have read some of the comments on this website concerning Pulp Fiction and perhaps I missed it but no one has mentioned the fact that Tarantino used an element from Elia Kazan's "On the Waterfront" in 1954 staring Marlon Brando. In Pulp Fiction, Marsellus Wallace told Bruce Willis that he is supposed to intentionally lose to a boxer named Wilson:Marsellus: "In the fifth, your ass goes down. Say it."Butch: "In the fifth, my ass goes down."Bruce Willis, not only doesn't go down and lose the fight, he kills Wilson. When I saw this, I became flushed with movie deja vu and felt very satisfied. Why was the boxer called Wilson? In "On the Waterfront" Marlon Brando has a famous monologue in which he expains how his boxing career ended: He went down intentionally against a boxer named Wilson because of greedy mobsters. Wilson, therefore was the invisble antagonist against Marlon Brando. Tarantino, being a smart guy, knew that in the deep annals of the film buff world, he could redeem Marlon Brando and all us film buffs that hate Wilson more than anything by killing Wilson. If it wasn't for Wilson, Marlon Brando "coulda been a contender." So, by killing Wilson forty years later, Tarantino effectively killed off the jerk that ruined Brando's Boxing career in "On the Waterfront." I don't know if many people had already realized this but I thought I would bring up to people's attention.Also, for Tarantino fans, watch "Kiss Me Deadly" (1955) by Robert Aldrich. It has the answer to why the contents of the briefcase, when opened by Travolta, give a glowing lightbeam on Travolta's face and we never see what's inside."

6,15-Aug-99,MovieAlien,2,4,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"Crap Fiction!","In a nutshell, the following elements causes a movie to be hyped beyond its own good:1.  Early trailers showing a movie with a huge cast, sex, drugs, and violence from a director who made an earlier hit and an underground genre as its subject.2.  After the trailer, it will respectively draw people in like sheep to see it.3. Sooner or later, there's a controversy about the movie's content, and yet it is still being raved about. Sooner or later the Academy of Motion pictures will knock on the director's door based on the amount  of sheep-people who love it.  It becomes a classic, and to those rare cases of actual humanoid lifeforms like myself, it's a hoopla B.S.Essentially, it's the hype that made this movie. If a film student approached a producer with the same idea, he'd get the hand. If you're Quentin Tarantino, you'd get Caviar and a warm welcome.  First of all, I didn't care for any one these characters. And where's the plot? Ooh, who needs one? Just turn these con men into philosophy majors, and have them drive around using four letter words all the time. Then make a bunch of vignettes out of this "plot"! Someone gets a big needle poked through their chest because they overdosed on cocaine! Ooh, shocking! Pump up the hype! They took the scientologist star of Saturday Night Fever and made him disco dance again! With Uma Thurman yet! Some shocking stuff here! But what does it all mean? Is it supposed to prove that even the most sleazy  people are smart and intelligent? Does it mean rape in a VCR repair store could be a hype getter in another movie? Could it mean that the "N" word is okay to use as long as your name is Quentin Tarantino and you're just making a movie?The emperor has no clothes. Or is it the hitman has no clothes? Or the drug dealer has no clothes? Whatever."

And to add insult, this black man takes the time not only to recite a line from the Bible, but to also interpret what he feels this line means to him! It's obvious cops aren't in this movie because the criminals act as if they don't exist. I mean they really ACT AS IF COPS DON'T EXIST. And I thought Tarantino's repeated use of the N-word was low class, unfunny, uttered simply for shock value, and painfully obvious being that we knew he was going to have a black wife, didn't we? It's like someone diving into the water, but not wanting to get wet. Having said that, I enjoyed Pulp Fiction. But how could anyone think this flawed film deserved to win Best Picture. 2.5 stars."

There are a large group of people out there who follow Tarintino's career and praise his genious and mastery at story-telling.  I am not one of them!To me, Pulp Fiction was a horrible film!  I thought the plots were boring, I thought that the movie was a waste of time, and I feel that way about everything that Tarintino has put out!  All he does is recycle the same garbage over and over, and the public praises him for it.  From my perspective, the only thing that I see in the film that I would consider an original idea about this film is the manner in which the story was presented (ie the sequence of events being presented as they were.)  However, if you really want to see a great and unique approach at story-telling, watch Memento!What it all boils down to is that I don't believe that Quentin Tarintino is any better a director than Britney Spears is an actress; but that's just my opinion!I Rate - * 1/2"

I say that most of 18+ teens would certainly like.The movie, which was a surprise Grand Prize-winner at the last Cannes Film Festival, is shockingly violent, provocatively obscene and profane. It won't just offend some audiences; it will offend the living hell out of them. Tarantino intends to rile people up.After the boxer story plays out, we slide back in time to the previous day, when we learn why the hit men showed up in strange college-guy clothes. It's because after the first hit, they took one of their spies home with them. While gesturing dramatically with a gun, Travolta learns why the first rule of gun safety is never point a gun at something you are not willing to destroy. The gun, as guns do, goes bang; the young man, as young men do when hit by bullets, goes ker-blooie. Thus follows a bizarre adventure in post-shooting hygiene, in which the two hit men, a suburban buddy (played by Tarantino himself) and an elegantly mysterious fixer (Harvey Keitel) deal with the problem of scrambled brains all over the upholstery."

6,22-Sep-21,everythingdiz,1,1,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"A landmark Disney movie. You read that right.","Not so well known fact: this was the highest grossing live-action Disney movie of 1994. It hauled in over $200 million worldwide, and the only other mouse house film to compel more people to sit in a dark box that year was The Lion King. I'd argue that Pulp's release is among the most pivotal moments in Disney's century-long history, and certainly one of its most overlooked.In some ways, this single film paved the way for Disney's immense buying spree throughout the last quarter century and its explosion into becoming the largest entertainment company in the world. Pulp's artistic and cultural impact has been well litigated, but its influence on emboldening a new approach to growth at Disney is effectively forgotten.This is the very first Miramax movie greenlit under Disney ownership after they bought the studio for $60 million in 1993. And its box office likely paid for the entire acquisition all by itself. Since this was the first time Disney had ever acquired another studio, without Pulp's sparkplug success there's a chance their future string of additions like ABC, ESPN, A&E, Lifetime, History, Freeform, Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm, 20th Century, Searchlight and Hulu might have never occurred as forcefully as it did. In retrospect, it's arguable that this one movie was the opening salvo in what became a $100 billion+ acquisition spree.As Disney structurally held Miramax at a significant distance, Harvey Weinstein turned it into his own devastatingly predatory, financially reckless fiefdom. It obviously became an extremely troubled purchase, and they parted ways with him in 2005, selling off the studio entirely in 2010. While they now haven't owned Pulp for over a decade, it did technically originate as a Disney movie and remained one for 15+ years. That Disney largely ignores the Miramax era is an inevitability of the nature of a publicly traded media behemoth. However, in a stroke of quiet irony, Disney-controlled Hulu released Untouchable - a notable documentary about the brave women who endured Harvey's trail of radioactive waste - in 2019.As a result of Disney effectively writing Miramax out of their corporate narrative, Pulp Fiction's role in the company's modern history has essentially evaporated. It likely provided early proof-of-concept to them that acquisitions can work, paving the way for the "Disney" we know today. There's a fairly direct line from Pulp Fiction in 1994 to Avengers: Endgame 25 years later. Both were critical and commercial triumphs of their genres, and each were stewarded by Disney's aggressive post-Walt growth ambitions. Some act like the company's record-shattering, acquisition-driven 2019 box office came out of nowhere, but I think the early seeds of it were being planted at Jack Rabbit Slim's 25 years earlier. That Disney no longer owns this movie but now owns The Seven Year Itch, a film paid homage to in that infamous restaurant, is a quiet encapsulation of what a central role Disney has played in stewarding popular culture past and present.Outside of its commercial success and unique place in entertainment history, the watershed release of Pulp Fiction simply remains a quietly singular moment in Disney's increasingly labyrinthine history. That they were creaking out middling Don Knotts movies not that long before this as the company stumbled toward being nearly smashed into oblivion by corporate raiders is a whiplash-inducing gear shift in retrospect. For better or worse, in 1994 the little mouse began to roar, and it wasn't just because of a lion cub."

The film opens with a couple played by Tim Roth and Amanda Plumber excellently by the way. In fact, there is not a single slacker in the whole film. Soon the viewer begins to realize these two people are up to no good. Then the film cuts to two hit men (John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson) who are on their way to extract money that a group of college kids owe their boss. Soon, more characters are added to the growing storyline and the intensity level is heightened.The sequences in this film are out of order. This is actually a good thing because the director, Quentin Tarantino(KILL BILL, JACKIE BROWN) doesn't want to show you that part of the story or that character yet. By doing this he is able to take the opportunity to continuously provide a consistent tone and level of humor while at the same time shocking us with unexpected graphic violence. I found this approach to be very stylish and effective in creating genuine emotion.The soundtrack perfectly complements the character's mindsets and the mood of the film. The end result makes for some really very memorable scenes throughout. While the film is basically a crime comedy, the music, in addition to the context of the scenes and the dialogue, are full of personality and classiness. This film is that it isn't for every taste. Sure there are things in this film that any open-minded viewer can admire about it, but the film is very over the top in it's scenes of graphic violence. One scene in particular is a grotesque nod to DELIVERENCE. This film is not for the squeamish. This is the kind of film that can be watched over and over and will always be exciting and fulfilling until the end. It's a modern classic. It's entertaining, brutal, funny, and unforgettable. It's a true classic that has inspired many many films and yet still manages to be just as entertaining as it was in 1994. It holds up perfectly and it's a must-see if you haven't seen it yet."

If you have the time or patience, go to my review of Mean Streets, Scorcese's classic hood drama from 1973. If Mean Streets made me feel icky, Tarentino's Pulp Fiction made me feel almost feverishly sick to my stomach. PF gave me cramps as I sat squirming through the buckets of blood, the sick humor, and all the talented and elegant film-making expended to bring forth this profoundly ugly movie.I'm not religious, but Pulp Fiction and its director's predecessor, Reservoir Dogs are almost . . . evil. I don't use that word lightly, nor do I feel particularly spiritual when I see movies, but this thing and its creator feel bad, just wrong.The best movie I have ever seen is Roman Polanski's Chinatown (Polanski isn't exactly a poster boy for virtue considering his notorious legal problems) and even though the bad guys win in Chinatown, Nicholson's J.J. Gittes is a virtuous man. Virtue defeated is still virtuous. Quentin Tarantino has created more than one film where there simply is no virtue (although Samuel L. Jackson's character makes an attempt toward the end of Pulp Fiction, the soul of the movie is a darkened husk by then).Pulp Fiction is a cheerless, hateful thing that finds humor in human beings accidentally losing their lives. When I saw it, I wanted to find out what all the buzz was about. When it was through, I was depressed, sad for the vermin on the screen and off.I've written that I like movies with grit and depth; my wife likes to be entertained. If you've never seen Pulp Fiction (or if you have and want to see it again), take my advice and rent something old and Disney.Or even Chinatown. At least there's somebody to root for."

Being about two bum hitmen who are just as funny as they are violent, I do not know why this film is so notorious for being "violent" and why it is talked about so much. The only real good thing about it was the excellent cast and the drama. There was little violence, with only 4 people shot in the film (including Travolta, who is shot after breaking into Willis's apartment) but the killings are quite brutal and Jackson always recites a Bible prayer before he does the killings. The acting is truly great though, and it is full of drama and different stories which finally come together at the end to have a pretty good movie but not worth all the great reviews. A decent film that should be watched if you have the time. Feel free to email me with any questions or comments."

Tarantino has a penchant for violence, as do many of the big name actors, like Jackson and Willis. But so does the human race. There's more to us and more to the film.The fact that it creates so many unanswered questions, the fact that I can watch it again and again and still see new things, even it's "tie-ins" to other QT movies all add up to a depth and complexity that uses violence and sex - it is not used by it.It's ironic that such a pulp/pop film could do it, but we live in a world of strip malls where we pick up donuts, a world with pawnshops run by long-hairs with Reb flags, and a world of people with accents from faraway places. It adds to a mystery - Where is it from (Fabienne's accent)? Why is she (Esmerelda Villalobos) here? None of these are crucial to the plot. Just like subway chatter and personal romance are not necessary for survival.Yet we find ourselves doing them, day in and day out.Why does Marsellus have a band-aid? What's in the briefcase? Why does mindless violence fascinate us? Why are we enamored with the intricate?"

I hope that's the reason why I don't think this is the great modern classic that everybody else does. However, 1994 was not that long ago.  Movies have not changed that much in the last 10 years.  All I heard about Pulp Fiction for years was how violent it was.  I'm sorry, it really just wasn't.  The supposedly brilliant and original characters in this movie don't really seem brilliant or original to me.  There all just kind of losers.  They're just losers in that glorified Tarantino way.  I thought both Kill Bills were much better than this movie.Finally, let me say that just because a movie jumps around between stories and characters does not automatically make it a good movie."

6,28-Jul-03,solongsuckers,1,2,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"Insightful, wonderful, geeky","Pulp Fiction is the ultimate playground for the mind of Quentin Tarrantino. The movie is a blindingly repressed spewage of pop culture, brilliant setup, drug excrement, softcore porn, and a magnificent mixture of philosophy, religion and violence.  The movie's mood almost has us as tied to a chair as Ving Rhames and Bruce Willis are in the excruciatingly painful gimp sequence.  Thus retrained, we are blasted on a whirlwind tour of the hippest of the hip.  So hip, in fact, that we want to blow our brains out after it is over.  Samuel Jackson gives the performance that will undoubtedly mark his career.  It is a performance that is disturbed, hysterical, deadly, funny, compassionate, smart and scared (yes, scared.)  He's a quote dynamo and is given more great things to say then possibly any character in movie history.  Travolta is slick, slimy and stupidly sharp in his role.  He's one of the few guys who comes off as an actor in this movie and not a lost soul in the new wave beat generation of the mid-90's.  The cast is a who's who of the best cult actors of the mid-90's and Tarrantino gets them to deliver stunning performances.  And why not?  The dialogue is possibly the best written verbage for any film ever made and is a Holy Grail for fans of offbeat and subculture cinema.  From "the holiest of holies" to "correctamundo", the movie is the masterpiece for a guy so immersed in pop culture that he needs an oar to navigate it all.  Roth is dynamic in a relatively small part and Ammanda Plummer is like a shrieking little wicked witch.  Uma Thurman is a thinking man's dream.  She's vulnerable, demonstrative, and most of all, playful.  The dancing sequence is priceless and needs no further discussion.  Eric Stoltz is like that cool guy that everyone knew in high school that no one really paid much attention to but everyone liked.  Bruce Willis is also in his zone as Butch the boxer. Willis has a nice blend of sensitivity and brutality.  Any more or less probably would not have worked.  The movie also rips on all cultures virutally equally with a burst of fresh air.  The movie is more sympathetic towards blacks and not at all towards Southerners but that is par for the course in the civil rights revival in the 1990's.  Shooting a movie of this length out of sequence was a tremendous gamble but the dialogue holds it together and it is, doubtlessly, brilliantly creative.  The movie's weakness, like other Tarrantino movies, is it's obsession with believing that the drug subculture is somehow right about life and most other facets are somehow less then right or flat out wrong.  Tarrantino evolved this idea slightly by the end of the movie and continued it in one of the best B-movies ever made, From Dusk Till Dawn.  However, Tarrantino's glorification of radicalism gets old at times and falls flat by the end of the movie due to it's length.  All in all, this movie is an all time classic for cinema junkies and pop culture nuts and will pop like champagne in circles away from the power players and the mainstream."

6,28-Sep-98,Dave-79,1,2,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"Quentin Tarantino creates a masterpiece.","Pulp Fiction.  The opening of this film consists of a literary definition of the title.  This alone should tell you what you are about to see cannot be compared to anything real.  But have you listened to the news or read the papers lately.  There's stuff going on the world that makes Pulp Fiction look like a day care center complete with cute bunnies.  Tarantino specializes in introducing us to characters, allowing us to get use to them, and he even getting us to like them.  Then all of a sudden he introduces an element that is so bizarre we barely have time to process it.  He doesn't give us time for it to sink in, but we still have to deal with this new direction while more stuff keeps happening.  The language, drug use, and violence are all incidental.  They are not "Glorified" by this movie.  If you make a movie about modern day gangsters in L.A. or any city, drugs and violence go hand in hand with it for it to be realistic in that respect.  I get the feeling Tarantino wants us to believe in the characters, dialogue, and overall initial premise.  Then he throws a monkey wrench into the works. How we react tells us a lot about ourselves. This is not my favorite movie ever, but it's definitely in my top 10.  I love the fact that there are as many people who love this movie as those who hate it.  That alone is a difficult achievement."

Sign in to vote.,"After watching Pulp Fiction, everything else will seem like bread and water...","Often copied but never duplicated, Pulp Fiction was an absolute sensation when it came out in 1994. It became an audience favourite, received universal praise from critics, won the Best Film at the Cannes Film Festival, and made director Quintin Tarantino into a household name. How many films out there can you fit into this category?Pulp Fiction is so famous for several reasons. First off, it's one of the most original films of the 90's. When most movies out there are either remakes, sequels, based on books, or on actual events, Tarantino gives us 2-inch sirloin steak that's bloody as hell. The plot is several stories all interelated in someway or another that weave in and out over a period of about 48 hours (give or take and afternoon) all within the shifty comings and goings of the LA drug life. Each story connects the characters together, like a puzzle within a puzzle, and is all held together strongly with a fantastic cast (John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis) and Acadamy Award worthy performances.Secondly, it has tremendous dialogue. Quintin Tarantino is an absolute genius in crafting the film's Oscar winning screenplay. This isn't made up nonsense. This stuff is real. Many of the dialogue you could so easily overhear from the people talking behind you in the grocery line. They're conversations of reality, and this is what helps make the film so good. And when it has to be, the script is sharp as a razor blade in which Samuel L. Jackson deserves much praise for. Thirdly, it is amazingly memorable. Most movies would be lucky to have about 2 memorable scenes; Pulp Fiction has about nine. Mia Wallace and Vincent Vega's fantastic twist dance scene became of the most iconic scenes of the 90's (I will admit I tried a few moves in front of my bedroom mirror). Mia getting stabbed with a syringe makes everyone's knees knock and who doesn't laugh darkly at Winston Wolf's scenes. The acting, the story, the characters, everything just works. That's all as I can describe it.After watching Pulp Fiction, everything else will seem like bread and water. So don't be afraid to watch this wildly outrageous, fantastic, bloody, and often surreal film that turned the 90's upside down. It's all that and a bag of chips. Get out there and rent it."

This movie has spawned more quotes than I can name, and every scene is memorable. Camera work is perfect as to be expected and the film looks beautiful. Tarentino uses violence as an art form. The acting is pretty amazing with an all star cast that really brings everything together. Jackson in particular is really intense, but that's his style. Travolta does an excellent job as very human hit-man Vincent Vega, bringing politeness and a little silliness to his profession. The dialogue is by far the best part of the film though. Vince and Jules's back and forth on subjects from the mundane to the existential are smart and hilarious. Pulp Fiction is also famous for its chronology, which throws most people off the first time they see it. The film asks you to think a little and that's a good thing in my opinion."

Like every other film of his this one contains memorable scenes, memorable dialogues and characters and an execution which can easily be identified as "Tarantinoesque". The film plays non-chronologically and involves two hitmen, a boxer, a mobster's wife and a diner. Each and every actor is amazing, so much so that you cannot imagine anyone else in the role. Travolta is especially good- no wonder this was a resurrection of sorts for the famed actor who was previously known for his dancing numbers.

Sign in to vote.,"Pure Artistry.","Imagine for a second, an eccentric filmmaker pitching an idea for a movie with three different story lines that all merit excitement and violence, except there's one catch...take all the "action shots" out of the picture and keep the rest of the unnecessary fodder behind and that's the movie. The result of that unusual requested visions happened to be a unique, interesting, and original movie. Written and directed by Quentin Tarantino, Pulp Fiction defines itself as a distinctive film that will amuse, shock, and hold the audience in suspense. Tarantino crafted his work in the mid- 90s, a time when originality was lacking in film industry, everything had a formula that had to followed to be considered a technically "good" movie. Roger Ebert claimed, "there are film classes, computer programs, and websites telling exactly how a movie should be made." The result of that is losing the one thing that movies are supposed to about: artistic expression. So what did Tarantino do? He showed the industry that every artist has their own voice. There shouldn't be collated, specific formula, because then the audience has the industry solved and rings out all magic is left to be discovered. In Pulp Fiction took three overplayed story lines and made us watch the "awkward" scenes. What we wouldn't see in other movies, the time in between the action. The meaningless conversations you and I have every day with our friends and family. That is another thing missing from movies back then, humanity! On top of the risky, futile dialogue driven scenes, Tarantino mixed up the chronological order of the picture. And on the cherry on top of Tarantino's sundae is the misfit, creepy characters he asks us to identify with. Yet, through all of that the movie manages to soar and define itself as reputable piece of art. And that's the simplest and best way to sum up Pulp Fiction is art. Not only through Tarantino's inventive screenplay, but through his delicately placed direction. Each shot is filled with something unique that'd driven by the motivation of the characters or the overall arc of the story. It's a masterfully directed piece. The direction is even more artistic than the screenplay. With the screenplay, as much work as Tarantino put into penning the words, the actors are in control of the success of those words being told. In the direction, Tarantino is in control and he never relinquishes that control making the audience really feel plunged into the idiotic situations the characters end up in. There are moments where Tarantino injects huge laughs, chiseling thrills, and always retaining the humanity of the story. The three stories are all different, they are their own piece, that all work toward the same goal of each other, however each section has it's own tone and exclusive arc, they all end with the same two things: a saving of someone's life and a secret. I believe Tarantino intended for that to be a metaphor for a director/writer in their creative world making their movies. To be successful they have to work to save the industry they are releasing their films to and they have to keep their own voice to themselves and be unique, so no one else can steal their style. Beyond Tarantino's creative efforts much lies behind the walls of Pulp Fiction. Tarantino adds to the film's statement of Hollywood by finding a way to inject movie references of some of the highest regarded motion pictures, including The Godfather. The film editing bounces off the screen, staying true to the characters at hand and the film's plot in the moment. It's tight, brisk, and entertaining, while still saying something. With such a strong effort from its direction and screen writing aspects, it's clearly stated that it's not going to be an actors movie, though the four principle actors deliver some great work. The standout performance is Samuel L. Jackson, his best works lies with the final scene of the movie. It's a heated scene and Jackson only adds to the intensity. Bruce Willis highlights his career with his role, while John Travola and Uma Thurma deliver fine acting jobs and line deliveries as well.The definition of Pulp is written on the screen for us before we meet any of the characters at the start of the picture, defined as "a soft, moist, shapeless mass of matter" and "a magazine or book containing lurid subject matter and being characteristically printed on rough, unfinished paper." That's exactly what this refreshing film is: messy, unorganized, and an unformed bulk of art. Rating: 10/10Grade: A+"

6,25-Feb-01,DJ Inferno,0,2,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"C-U-L-T!!!!!!!","What´s so special about "Pulp Fiction"? There are dozens of ideas you´ve seen in other film before, the dialogues are trivial (about junk food, foot massages, serials on television...) and the plot is very confusing when you see this movie for the first time. The solution: "Pulp Fiction" is a penny dreadful on celluloid. Same as other cult movies like "A clockwork orange" or "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" you will get something, you´ve never seen before: a complete new style of film making! Tarantino´s masterpiece is full of strange types, striking conversations and scenes (especially Mia´s and Vincent´s dance, when Uma Thurman gets resuscitated...), a brilliant cast (John Travolta in the best role he ever played!), which would have been enough for five other films and a great soundtrack! At last it is also an homage about L.A., the city the director is living in. The whole story gets its thrill from the fact that the watcher has to combine all the different periods and places like a puzzle. A shame that "Pulp Fiction" only got two academy awards, because it has all ingredients a real cult movie has got to have: the film was copied for a hundred times, especially in the 90s, big guns became a status symbol of the modern cinema. Watch it 9 or 10 times and you will always find something new! Cult as cult can!!! My IMDb rating: a perfect 10!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

There are "The Bests", including movies like "The Godfather", "American Beauty" and "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly", but I've always thought that there was no "Best" movie.Then I saw "Pulp Fiction"...and if I had to name any movie as "The Best", this would definitely be it.The plot has three different stories, intersecting and coming apart.  The first and main stories has hit men Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winfield (Samuel L. Jackson) recovering a case for their boss Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames), and a subplot about Vince taking Marsellus' wife Mia (Uma Thurman) out for some fun.  The second story has prizefighter Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) being pursued by Marsellus for refusing to throw a fight - the two fall into some disturbing chaos.  The last and smallest plot is about two petty crooks (Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer) who decide to rob the diner that they're having breakfast in.I haven't mentioned this yet, but the film is written and directed by Quentin Tarantino.  After this and "Reservoir Dogs" I think it's safe to say that he's one of the greatest writers of our time.  His lines manage to be cool but don't get too artificial like David Mamet's or slogan-like like William Goldman's (who are both still great).  His stories are the most creative of creative writing, his lines are awesome, his characters brilliant.And brilliant they are.  My personal favorite character is Jackson's cool, foul mouthed, Bible quoting hit man who has a religious experience after surviving what seems to be a now-way-out gunfight.  Jackson's performance is spot on, perfect, nothing beats this kind of acting.My second favorite is Butch.  Bruce Willis isn't a good actor - most of the time.  Thank God for movies like this, "Die Hard" and "12 Monkeys" for the guy to show his abilities.  His performance is perfect, Oscar worthy all the way.Speaking of the Oscars, it's a pity this didn't dominate.  If I had it my way it would've picked up Best Picture, Director, Actor (Travolta), Supporting Actor (Jackson), Supporting Actress (Thurman) and Best Editing, instead of Tarantino just getting one for the screenplay.  Oh, and Bruce Willis would get a nom for himself.The Best of The Best, 10/10."

Does anybody seriously expect us to believe, as Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) suggested, that "God came down from heaven, and stopped the bullets," when he and Vincent Vega (John Travolta) were shot at? It wasn't God's hand, but the shaky hand of a man who couldn't shoot straight, and ended up paying for it with his life."

Had this screenplay been submitted to a screenwriting teacher, it would of gotten a D-.  It destroys all conventional writing rules.  Within twenty minutes of the film, we have been introduced to at least five barely linking major characters.  It's heavy on talk (But what talk!)  By the time the supposed lead (John Travolta as a cool moving hit-man/drug abuser) and his "date" (Uma Thurman as a gangster's wife) win the dance contest, you are saying "I am forty-five minutes into this film.  I have no idea what is going on, but I love it!"       PULP FICTION took the old textbooks on screenwriting, and burned it, stomped on the remains, and kicked it down the drain.  It wrote a new book on screenwriting, making it one of the most important films in American Cinema."

Sign in to vote.,"Most overpraised movie of the last 100,000 years","Gen-x audiences, overstuffed by the yupped-out aesthetic of the Spielberg/John Hughes eighties, were dying for a soupcon of seventies grunge--something urban and gritty, but ironic and retro, to fit the cynical, beat-out, slackitudinous mood of the late George Bush era. That's how Quentin Tarantino served his wake-up call to the world with RESERVOIR DOGS in 1991, the alarm clock that jolted American cinema's eyes open after the long coma between BLUE VELVET and it. And PULP FICTION was the one that knocked the ball out of the park--commercially speaking. To find a cultural nerve-pinching phenomenon of similar force, you'd have to go back to BONNIE AND CLYDE or EASY RIDER. But even they didn't have the seismic, global force of this movie: it may be hard to remember a few years later, but this picture, and its author, were burned onto the public consciousness and referenced 24/7 for long, long after its release.Seen in retrospect, it's clear what put the movie over--it's like a smooth, upscale theme store stocked with gen-x fetish items (heroin! faded seventies icon! jherri curls! tongue-in-cheek machismo! Kool and the Gang! Fruit Brute!) that could make the most out-of-it yahoo feel like a hipster.What's also clear is that it's a logy, stilted, stagebound piece of work that doesn't seem to take place in any lifelike universe, even a stylized one. The only rhythm the movie can claim is that of a writer impressed with his ability to make coiled, jivy dialogue. Scenes drag on and on as Tarantino keeps on stylin'. The center section of the movie--a boxer's romance with a French honeypie and his escape from a gangster he's double-crossed--is so thoroughly leaden and spontaneity-deprived you'd think it would've been enough to sink the movie alone. But somehow the combination of the star-studded cast and the "inside"-y, you-can-be-hip feel of the picture made it a blockbuster of the calibre usually reserved for movies about skyscrapers or planets exploding.Sadly, Tarantino, after a long, nail-biting hiatus, made his first genuinely great movie, JACKIE BROWN, which highlights all his strengths and eschews each of his flaws. All the fans who obsessed over the smallest minutiae of PULP greeted this impressive, grown-up work with a shrug and a quick retreat."

It did two things for me. It explained why I should not come here and put a comment although it also entertained me thoroughly. This could be conflicting statements but it just what happened. Yes I watched and understood very little but seeing those dead pan actors I enjoyed often in many of their movies was really a rewarding experience, yet it certainly did not enhance my self-esteem! For more understanding I read, here, Kilopod's review, the first fairly comprehensive review I scrawled to and found it very enlightening but it also may have led me to a sad conclusion about myself. I don't know if it is my hearing defect or my thinking defect that left me in the "noir with that "comedie noir". There was a suggestion that one should see this work several times to fully appreciate it. Perhaps I'll need to hire a version with subtitle for my next viewing as dialogues in it are said to be "the icing on the cake"... And perhaps for this particular movie "spoiler"warning should be lifted or recommended as the more you know about the story possibly the more you will enjoy it."

I can see that many people praise its "its fragmented storyline, eclectic dialog, irony and camp influences, unorthodox camera-work, and numerous pop culture references". Before calling it one of the best pieces of moving pics we gotta keep a few things in our mind.We gotta roll then over in our heads. ***One would wonder why a professional such as Vincent would not keep his gun on him: the answer may be that it was Marsellus' gun. And yet another clue may be that Vince does nothing when the door to Butch's apartment opens: he thinks he knows who it is. But can anyone give an exact answer? It may be just a coincidence right? ***The rapists take Marsellus into the back room and rape him; Butch escapes his bonds and in a disturbing, comic, and somewhat surreal scene. Does anyone think this was a unrealistic scene? He could untie those sturdy robes just because he is a boxer?(He is definitely not a palooka as he is called by Vincent but it still seems far-fetched?) ***While driving back to the motel from the apartment complex, Butch accidentally (and literally) runs into Marsellus himself.Another divine intervention right? ***Jules himself, after he and Vincent are shot at repeatedly from point-blank range yet survive?? I understand that redemption and divine intervention are two themes that drive us to think but the way I think is that these are not just like that. They sound more like like a coincidence.That's why I don't see this movie as a piece of perfection!One should think before giving it a top-ten vote!"

While, it will take you a couple of times to watch to decide whether you like it or not, Pulp Fiction is a unique film with top-class actors, grade-A acting, a superb storyline, and heaps of plot twists and turns.It's all about a web of people who's lives intertwine with eachother for various reasons. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson star as the two main characters, who turn in great performances, while Harvey Kietel and Uma Thurman are also great, but aren't in it as much.Bruce Willis is also great here as a boxer, on the run from a hitman, while Eric Stoltz plays one of Travolta's dope-smoking associates.Not a film for the slow-minded, 'Pulp Fiction' is a fast-paced adventure ride, that you'll laugh at, love and hate, all at the same time."

John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman and Ving Rhames are also in on the action. This film is excellent in many ways. The dialogue is snappy and sharp, the acting is brilliant and the story is so clever. Basically, the whole story is based around a crime boss(Rhames) and his mysterious brief case. We start off the film with Mr Roth and his partner robbing a diner, and from that moment on, the audience can sit back and stare in amazement at the talent shown on screen. All the stars give a career best. There are superb confrontations between the actors-Mr Rhames and Mr Willis, Mr Jackson and Mr Roth, Mr Willis and Mr Travolta, Mr Travolta and Ms.Thurman, Mr Keitel and Mr Tarantino and Mr Jackson and Mr Travolta. It leaves the audience wondering who knows who and for what reason. Its the exact intelligence that made Jackie Brown so tremendous. Rating=5/5"

His world.  A world where the so-called "anti-socials" are far more complicated than the "normal people" (as I´m writting this, and I use the term "normal people" I laugh, and feel dirty).  These anti socials are haunted by greater problems.  Self-finding issues. Tarantino uses the questions raised by one-self to make the characters of the movie think about their lives.  To think about what they´re doing with them.  As Jules says, he´s trying to be the sheperd.  Even God gets involved.  Even God has a chance.  Even bad guys can change. In more technical purposes, the director (Q. Tarantino), uses an infinity of signs, and symbols to put us throughout the story...once again, not a simple plot, but a whole world.  The camera movement, although not ground-stomping, jaw-dropping, is fine.  One thumb up.  Fine directing. The story, on the other hand...woooow!  Leaves me speechless, breathless, etc.  It´s an extasy just to read the script, just to think of it as a book.  Hats off for Tarantino as a writter...Avary too.     Finally, bashing a little bit, Tarantino needs some expertise as a director, but his writting skills are top-notch."

Uma Thurman is good as Marcellus's pretty, but drugged up wife who likes to dance, the excellent Tim Roth is one of the bandits who is intent on retiring from crime after one last job. Then you've got Bruce Willis as the boxer, who spends more time looking for his watch more than anything else.

It is becoming a film classic and a must see for generations now coming of age. A metaphor for what Tarantino does here with the storyline is what a magician does with torn paper. We all know the trick...the magician has a participant from the crowd take a piece of paper and tear it up in front of the audience. He places the paper into a top hat, waves the magic wand, and voilà...the paper is whole again.Tarantino does that with the storyline. Scenes shift to different time sequences yet all tie together at the end. The genius is that the viewer must now take the scenes and rearrange them to understand the true sequence. It is, by all accounts, brilliant.The film is responsible for resurrecting the career of John Travolta. At this time Travolta was somewhat of a failed commodity in Hollywood. His performance here proved he could do some seriously good acting. Samuel L. Jackson, Ving Rhimes, Bruce Willis, and Uma Thurman all provide standout performances as do all the other actors. Of special note are two of the greatest actors in Hollywood who had somewhat small roles. As Shakespeare said "there are no small parts, just small actors". That is why Harvey Keitel is so memorable in his role, and Christopher Walkin in his.Rent the movie, buy the movie, tape it from cable (do not see it on network TV you'll hate yourself if that is the way you see it) but see this movie. After you've seen it once, think about it a little bit and then wait a little while and see it again...that is how good this flick is!"

I guess my favorite attribute about this movie is the unique direction by Quentin Tarentino.  Instaed of having an average crime drama with lots of cool killing like most movies, he intertwined three different stories and one cool scene into a superb look at crime.  Tarentino makes criminals look not as much like one-dimensional Gods, as most movies do, but he makes them look like average human beings that have morals, weaknesses, and personalities. He shows how crimianls make mistakes, and that their reasons for killing aren't just for the hell of it.  He shows how criminals think, feel, react, etc.  Besides that, the cast is just exceptional.  Harvey Keitel, Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, etc. all make the movie experience more fun.  They all are wonderful stage presences, to say the least.  Another cool thing about the film that is often overlooked is it's image.  It has this image that is just impossible to describe, like how American Beauty or Fight Club moth have their images.  The colors, the sets, the dialouge, the characters all come together to create this image, and, let me tell you: it's just awesome.  It's a fun movie with witty dialouge. I can't get enough of this movie.  And, oh yeah, the infamous basement scene with the...I won't give it away.  It's very awful and disgusting but it's not like the entire movie is centered around it, so just watch it, and see how it plays a vital part in the development of Bruce Willis's charcater. See it, you'll love it (But first see Resovoir Dogs.""

The direction was choppy at best, the plot so convoluted no one could follow it (what little plot there was), and the wonderful actors doing this film wasted both their time and their talent. There is no direction in this storyline whatsoever. This movie is only a vessel for gratuitous violence, sex, and drug use. There are no "good guys" in this movie, and no redeeming qualities. But there is a plus to it -- if you happen to have some sort of hallucinogen lying around, the movie is almost bearable. For an equally tasteless pro-drug flick, viewers should check out "Half Baked"."

Tarantino had avoided the sophomore slump and crafted a film that pilfers from just about anything you can imagine and manages to create one of the most unique films of the decade. It's a crime drama, film-noir, gangster flick, black comedy....you get the idea. True, it's a graphic film: graphic violence, graphic language, graphic drug content, and a graphic rape sequence; it ain't for the squeamish. But it also has some of the most fluid monologues cinema has ever produced. Not to mention that it did wonders for the careers of its principals: Travolta's career was in full-throttle after this one; likewise with Jackson, and Thurman. The foundation was laid with "Reservoir Dogs" and "True Romance" - this is the film that established Tarantino as a director of a higher order. And the imitators have been playing catch-up ever since."

The first begins with a prologue in a coffee shop, then takes you to an apartment where some thugs get capped off by Jules and Vince. Then the next stories' about Vince taking his bosses' wife on a date, and then goes on to tell about a boxer who stiffs Marcelus of a bribe, and then graduates to explain the prologue. Homophobes may not want to watch this one. There is a scene that will make you cringe as I did the first time. The dialogue is what makes this film unique, original, and funny as hell.

How about "ground-breaking" or "extremely innovative". Being probably one of the most distinctive films of the 1990`s, "Pulp Fiction" is an offbeat, gritty, but hysterically funny film about two hitmen, their boss, his crack-addicted wife, a boxer and a few eccentric but fascinating characters and and their bizarre stories. There are about 4 or 5 stories in this film (I can`t remember, I saw this a year ago), that all overlap each other, and they`re not in chronological order either. It sometimes can be confusing, but I`m sure you`ll be able to understand it. The script for this film is sheer genius, as John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson, the two hitmen, argue about everything from Big Macs to shooting someone in the back of their car. Uma Thurman is radiant as the unconventional, junkie who likes to dance and crack silly jokes. "Pulp Fiction" doesn`t really have a plot, it sort of like a collection of a few stories, that don`t really go anywhere. There a few bloody moments, but you`ll be laughing hysterically, it`s THAT MUCH of a black comedy. The film`s low budget is very visible, but that just creates an even more raw atmosphere. "Pulp Fiction" is not a film for everyone, but if you enjoy an outrageously funny, startlingly original and dark film, this is for you."

Every crime drama/comedy out there can try as hard as it wishes but it will never ever surpass Pulp Fiction. Pulp Fiction follows the story of to very likable hit man Vince and Joules (John Travolta and Sam Jackson) and a boxer who is in a lot of trouble (Bruce Willis). There story's are both compelling and original and eventually they run across each other. If you have seen any other Tarentino film you will know how he tells the story with flashbacks and eventually it all comes together. Quinten Tarentino's movies always have a certain amount of character and dialog that make them what they are. Pulp fiction is one of those films which you can't think of anything it lacks. Well I thought may be it could have used more action but if it did it wouldn't be what it is.So all in all buy this movie right now watch it love it remember it because it will be a long time before someone makes another crime drama/comedy this good.

It deals in terms of an artists/athletes/etc. who's second effort lack's the success of their initial. In movies, many filmmakers go through this exact struggle (Kevin Smith I'm looking at you.) But, like every rule, there are exceptions. And, oh boy, is this one ever.Quentin Tarantino started his film career by penning the script to 'True Romance.' An enjoyable, yet ultimately forgettable work. He followed that up by directing his desk script, shot on a minuscule budget. That film happened to be 'Reservior Dogs,' and the rest is history. Following the success that was 'Dogs.' QT finds himself in a more comfortable position to make his second film (and I'm sure the fact that he made it independently rather than under a big studio helped.) His sophomore effort was 'Pulp Fiction' and it has changed the cinematic experience from the get-go. This little 8 million dollar film blew up to be a 100 million dollar plus investment, becoming a hit not only in the states, but internationally.Why was it such a hit? The movie speaks for itself. Don't believe me? Read anyone else review who delves into trivial details than provide much of the greatness. The acting is great. The directing is great. The writing is some of the best and wittiest dialogue I've ever heard. The movie somehow manages to be hilariously dark and an exercise in bad-assery (if that's even a word.) 'Pulp Fiction' isn't just required viewing for hardcore movie lovers, it's a required film for anyone of the human race. 'Pulp' will never get old, it will always remain timeless and my favorite movie of all time because of that."

This movie is filled with terrific conversations between the characters that makes it such a delight to listen to. It isn't flawless though- I felt that entire sequence with Bruce Willis, was way too long, and bordering on the line of boring. But the last 30 minutes or so of the movie is perhaps the best 30 minutes of cinema anyone can ever experience. Starting from the scene in the car where Vincent's little 'accident' occurs, all the way to Jimmy's place and the last scene in the diner is absolutely riveting and most enjoyable to watch. The cast is just amazing, and although I thought Samuel L. Jackson was simply the best, I also really liked Quentin Tarantino's little role- he was wonderfully irritating as Jimmy. The people against all the drugs, violence and profanity should just stop whining- I mean, the movie isn't encouraging this type of behaviour, and besides, they are a bunch of gangsters, so what else would you expect?"

6,9-Aug-04,202222,1,2,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"Indebted to Jean-Luc!","Just a couple of points. In the 1950s and 60s, French 'nouvelle vague' (new wave) directors, such as Francois Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard, made films based on the American pulp crime tradition, filtered through European notions of art cinema. But you knew that, right? Thing 'Breathless' and 'Shoot the Pianist'. An, of course, 'Bande a Part', after which Tarantino named his production company. So essentially 'Pulp Fiction' is American crime re-interpreted in the light of the French interpretation of it in the 60s. It contains several references to Godard, most notably the dancing scene (Tarantino is on record as saying this was directly inspired by 'Bande a Part'). And The Wolf's arrival in 9 minutes and 37 seconds refers to the scene in the same film in which the characters run through the louvre in record time. The moment when Mia tells Vincent not to be square and a square appears on the screen is also pure Godard. So basically, this is an all American film that could not have been made without the high priest of European arthouse cinema. Which you could see as fairly ironic, and something that gets missed very easily by US critics."

The iconic opening conversation about what they call fast-food abroad, between the two mob men, Vincent and Jules, sets a trend of witty dialogue and black comedy throughout the film. Vince (Travolta) seems to be the most thuggish of the pair who clearly enjoys his brutal job, where as Jules (Samuel Jackson) comes across as the more virtuous, spitting out memorable biblical quotes throughout the film. The layered masterpiece must be watched again and again to enjoy its full potential. With a simple yet uniquely assembled plot this film plays host to a string of great characters that will never be beaten, nor will there ever be a film quite like it."

The first speeches between Travolta and the other hit man were contrived and rigid. I didn't buy it. But it got better as it went along. It had some stimulating plot twists, especially when Bruce Willis had to decide whether or not to rescue the man who had been out to kill him ten minutes earlier. It reminds me of THE INTERLOPER by Saki, when two bitter enemies were trapped by a fallen tree and became friends, only to be rescued.... by wolves. The part about the gold watch being hidden up a man's certain area for years was supposed to be funny but I thought it was not and it ruined a plot that until then was supposed to be taken seriously. The writer makes an excellent showing as Jimmy who doesn't think his house has a certain sign on it. Bruce Willis was the best actor in this movie and that doesn't say that much for it since he isn't really the new Laurence Olivier. But PULP had some bite and some very good moments. Why don't we all respect each other and stop ripping anyone who doesn't agree with our opinions about movies? Lets stop insisting that anyone who doesn't agree with me is a moron.

That is because they trigger emotional responses from me, in most cases, dissapointment and hate.  But here, I am writing this review because I felt awe after seeing this movie.  I absolutely love this film. The dialogue is hilarious and it provides great insight into the lives of those involved in organized crime.  Fiction or not, it still is pretty realistic. There are several great things about this movie.  1)  Characters.  The characters portrayed by.....everyone in this movie are great.  These characters have depth, humor, and are colorful. 2)  Story.  This is not a movie for people who only half pay attention. A lot of laughs are caused during this movie because you think, "So that's why that happened."  People complain that this movie has no plot.  If you can't find a plot, look harder.  It is basically about the lives of 4 people over a course of 2-3 days.  Even though it is so simple, the situations these people go through in these days are comical and interesting. 3)  Direction.  Tarantino is just plain great.  The camera angles and sets are colorful and cool.  The moods are dark and, well, moody and the music is incredibly well matched to the scenes and locations.  Good job, amigo. This may not be a movie for everyone.  But if you like movies like "The Usual Suspects" and "Four Rooms,"  don't pass this one up. Final Thought:  Great, one of my top 10."

6,13-Mar-99,Casa2000,0,0,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"An Original Hollywood","Usually you will not find a film like "Pulp Fiction" come out of the highly formulaic realm of Hollywood.  That is precisely why Pulp is so popular with audiences and critics, the time has come for a new breed of film within the industry.  There are a number of elements which makes Pulp Fiction one of the best and most important films in Hollywood.Something that is very original about Pulp Fiction is of course its structure.  It is both a narrative and non-narrative film at the same time. Tarantino takes on the roles of a novelist and a filmmakers, simultaneously. He tells three stories instead of the conventional single story and they are told through a number of perspectives.  This makes the film much more interesting than usual and it tightens the shared universe that all the characters dwell in.Tarantino's film is not meant to be a parody like many interpret it.  It is supposed to represent real-life.  The film's structure is circular; the film ends where and when it began to represent the perpetual crisis of life, the unending conflicts that exist within the reality we live in.In fact, Tarantino emphases this point by attacking the Hollywood interpretion of life and displaying a conflict and contrast within that. Tarantino stereotypes many elements of his film to that of the conventional Hollywood presentation.  He typifies the crime genre with his characters (2 washed-up hitmen, the crime boss, the crime boss's wife), their costumes (black, sullen), the violence, the death, the drugs.  We see it all but then it is all twisted out of its conventional shape.  The hitmen do not talk like usual hitmen displayed on film.  They talk of TV pilots, toe massages and filthy animals.  And even though they start out in the typical gangster situation with an assigned murder and retrieval of some goods, we then follow them for the rest of the day, instead of abandoning that story right then and there.  We see conflicts and situations arise that are very unexpected and unusual for men such as these.  Both their language and situations are atypical of their stereotype.  We see that people of this constructed, everyday world do not go through a formula of life, they experience life in a seemingly unplanned fashion, just like real-life.And when you look at Pulp Fiction nowadays, it has the very appealing retrospective ensemble cast.  What I mean by this is that now everyone in it is a big star but back in 1994, they weren't all that they are now.  John Travolta was wash-up and Pulp redeemed his career, Samuel L. Jackson was not well known, Bruce Willis had come off a bunch of box-office bombs like The Bonfire of the Vanities and Mortal Thoughts, Uma who?, Ving Rhames was a vitual unknown, Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer are purely creations of Quentin Tarantino, Eric Stoltz was trapped in the 80s teenage genre.  In fact, Harvey Keitel was probably the only star but his character in the film was purely a creation of Hollywood and maintained that way throughout.  This film still has a lot of appeal when you look at the cover box in a video story nowadays because it has this huge cast.Tarantino's direction is also not that larger-than-life style that you are used to in a big Hollywood film.  He lets his actors live and really indulge into their characters.   He lets action take shape and remain on screen longer than would be expected such as Jules taking a long sip from a Big Kahuna coke or Butch walking to his apartment to retrieve his gold watch.  He puts lots in the edges of the frame like the board games Operation and Life while Mia is about to get her adrenline shot.  He integrates subliminal messages into his scene which take repeat and careful viewings to extract.  Pulp has so much, both on the surface and within; much more than Hollywood is used to.When you watch Pulp Fiction, try to remove yourself from those who feel they have to love it because everyone else does.  Love it for what it really has and for what you can really see and feel.  Watch Pulp Fiction over and over, and with each viewing look for something new and you will find it.  You will usually only find a film with any similar merit as Pulp Fiction in the realm of non-narrative, avant garde cinema.  But now that style has invaded Hollywood so take advantage of its genius and enter the world of fiction (but remember that nothing is as it seems, maybe even the title)."

I have been watching it every week since it was made, kind of obsessed with this one. This movie blows your mind totally and keeps you enchanted from the opening shot till the ending shot. A lot has been said about it already so i don't want to spoil the fun. All i want to say is that if you like movies and have not seen this one, you are a loser. I am not sure what to call the best about this flick. The plot, the shots, the music, the performances , it is overwhelming.its never too late, watch it now.

Only dead head 'arty' wannabe's would pretend to like it!","This is one of the most pathetic films i have ever seen. the acting is wooden, the storyline (if it can be called that) is convoluted and weak, scenery is boring and only weak minded followers will sit and say that the film was any good. John Travolta was  obviously trying to make a comeback and I don't know who he paid for the reviews, but for some obscure reason, other critics jumped on the tailfeathers and 'raved' over this film. Which is a shame that they can't stand on their on 2 feet and say what needs to be said about this trivial sorte into bland, mild mannered toilet humour sex scenes, inane attempts at humour and woeful blase acting. This film stinks! I refuse to follow like a sheep and even pretend to like it, possibly one of the worst and certainly one of the most over-rated movies ever shown to the public."

Pulp Fiction is the film that ressurected John Travolta's career and also catapulted Samuel L. Jackson's. A Brilliant mix of violence and humour saw Tarantino (the former LA video store worker) collect his Oscar for Best Screenplay and open a new style of movies in Hollywood. Boasting one of the best casts of any movie with stars such as Bruce Willis, Tim Roth, Ving Rhames, Christopher Walken and Travolta and Jackson, Pulp Fiction is the must watch movie of the decade with a great plot, brilliant script and flawless cast."

PF is a masterpiece which finally breaks ground in the big vacant lot that Hollywood has (until now) been a-feared to trod upon. Only someone with no fear of the "Hollywood Machine" could make such a movie. This lashing-out of Tarantino's claw opened a gash in the blue-blooded Hollywood flesh, and it's about time! It may seem to run a little long at times, but the opening of a new category of film is worth the few slow-moving periods. I personally believe that the biggest success here is Tarantino's rise from a video rental clerk to a major film director. For those who have a desire to go down a certain path, do what QT did and see what happens!"

The Acting, plot, screenplay, directing, cinematography, dialog, and everything about this film just ROCKS.  The dialog is probably the real attraction for this film, because it is SO WELL WRITTEN that it is almost like you're just watching 2 people chat about things...Be it Sam & John, John & Uma, Bruce & Ving, or Bruce & Maria, every line in this film is instantly recognizable, and completely memorable.  the Acting is awesome, everyone looks so natural in their parts that it is completely believable that John is a Hitman, Bruce a Boxer, or Ving a Mob Boss.  The way everyone acts flows smoothly, and the Chemistry of the people involved is a once in a lifetime kind of scenario.  It appears to me as, almost, a documentary on this group of people, and their lives...Absolutely the best film I have seen in MANY YEARS."

For the cinema "buff" who will appreciate something different and not be threatened by something out of the mainstream watch Pulp Fiction.  Nearly 80% of independent films have an element of Pulp Fiction in them.  Be it the dialogue dealing with pop culture, in your face violent scenes or the new film noir look which Tarantino invented.  One can appreciate this film for many reasons.  For one, Tarantino does not treat the audience like total idiots much the way most directors do.  He will let us judge things on our own and more importantly he does not attempt to save the world.  Every scene was skillfully thought out and perfected.  If his style offends you then perhaps you can rent "The Sound of Music" or "Pretty Woman" and get your spirits up again!"

Each story and set piece so silkily woven around an underbelly that is usually used to coarser a cloth.No member of the cast is found wanting. No part of the storyline a disappointment. If violent movies have to be made, then this is the way to make them. The cartoonish manner of both characterization and action makes it far more digestible than films such as Goodfellas.A special mention for Samuel L Jackson. He is the axle on which the whole thing turns. I think he was highly underestimated and was generally crowded out in the plaudits by supporters of cinema's prodigal son,- John Travolta.Score 9/10"

Sign in to vote.,"The Highlight of our Arbitrary Occurrence","Pulp Fiction is merely a stage of randomness accentuated by ironies and goofs intertwining the roles each brilliant actor in it plays, not as a specific person. But as normal people. It was with a sense of quirky, cynical normality void of the formulaic prosaicness in cliché action flicks, that Director Quentin Tarrantino instigated the production, and hence boosted his fame into a household name of Pulp Fiction. Each actor plays a strong mental part in a precarious and cavernous compilation of events, which in a formulaic sense of direction would conclude idyllically with the bad guys locked away and the good guys grinning ear to ear.. But here's the ingenious twist to it.. There are no 'good guys' in the film! With witty mockery in his tone, good camera angles and blundered events, Quentin Tarrantino presents us with a cast of people who appear perfectly normal and then twist on a downward, devilish spiral. Simply said, Quentin Tarrantino castigates the formulaic 'good guy' in cheap action flicks with solid good to bad guy transitions inherent in each one of the most memorable cast of actors of the '90s. Tim Roth's Ringo and Amanda Plummer's Yolanda are just two characters whose quirky discussion at an average bar paves their identities from good to evil as Ringo deduces that robbing a coffee shop can be just as lucrative and more subtle than a bank heist. The last scene of the movie plays brilliantly to this effect as Jules and Vincent alleviate the situation. Quentin Tarrantino beautifully intertwines the story of Jules and Vincent in the coffee shop heist by showing us their random discussion of hamburgers and their translations overseas. Their stories along with the dazzling choreography of Mia and Vincent at a Saturday Night restaurant sets a stage of purely inspired abnormality. In order not to give away the rest of the plot of the film which has been generally known and globally discussed since the year of its release, I will cut my comment short by saying that if you wish to see anomalous directing, decked with a cast that is anything but incompetent, see this now.."

Quentin Tarantino is an auteur of the 90s and has proven a masterful director for great ensemble casts, an insightful well-developed script, inspiring and striking camera angles and cinematography, and has developed a new genre of gangsters, crime, and mystery with an array of violence, drugs, sex, and fast-paced action.  John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson are dynamic and deliver powerful performances as a duo of hitmen, Bruce Willis is compelling (in one of his finest roles) as a prize-fighter and struggling boxer, and Uma Thurman is memorable as a sexy drug addict.  All these lowlifes are connected in one way or another to big time mafia leader Ving Rhames who happens to be Thurman's husband.  Movie is also unique in the sense that it is broken up into different scenes that don't seem to go in order from beginning to end.  Obviously the movie is not for all tastes for its dehumanizing and repulsive theme which is evident in every single scene. Nominated for several Oscars including Best Picture, Pulp Fiction is a mezmerising ride.  9/10"

This movie has no plot. It is completely story telling, kind of like the movie Smoke, but with better stories. These stories just happen to involve the same people. They don't always go in chronological order, but that doesn't matter. You have to realize each story is not supposed to be connected. Also, this movie isn't about gangsters or gangs or the mafia. It offers no insight into that lifestyle and is not supposed to. It is very far from reality, no gangsters are this eloquent and interesting and quirky. The characters in the stories just happen to be criminals.Also, this movie is not violent at all. People may disagree because of the Marvin scene, but you DO NOT see him get shot, you only see what happened afterwards. I guess people think that is violence. There is a lot of humor in this movie, in words and in actions. For instance when Butch, (Bruce Willis) goes back to save Marsellus, he is choosing his weapon of destruction in the pawn shop. He picks up various items ranging in killing power, such as a bat, a chainsaw,etc. He finally decides on a Samuri sword. All in all, an excellent movie."

The dialogue in this film was very sharp and laugh out loud funny at times. Travolta and Jackson play two of the best hit men I have ever seen in a movie. I also think Uma Thurman played the part of the boss's wife perfectly. I think this film also showed a different side to Bruce Willis. He is usually typecast as an action hero, but in this movie he was shown as more than just that. I have never seen a Tarantino movie before, but after watching this I have decided that I will change that because I like his style. Usually I would be put off by the plot not being easy to follow, but I think it adds to the craziness and style of this film."

Because he is a rising director, I believe that many of the critics don't want to miss the mark, so they complemented this film far above what it was, Pulp Trash.  Many have said it was John Travolta's greatest film, they missed the mark there also.  Tarantino had a web site about the same time the movie was released to explain to the viewers the nuances of his film.  It was really about saving many people's souls, that is what was in the black briefcase.  I see films like this and all I can think is that the writer got wasted and wrote down his great ideas while he was wasted.  The only thing that this film can do is to serve as an example of how not to entertain."

I don't understand why the violence in this movie was so hyped up.  I think there were about 4 violent scenes in the movie (the opening scene, the accidental shooting, the S&M rednecks, and the confrontation between Bruce Willis and John Travolta). Although the scene with the S&M guys was pretty disgusting, it only lasts about 3 seconds, any R rated action movie that's come out in the last 10 years has more violence than Pulp Fiction did.  I really look at Pulp Fiction as a comedy, a satirical view of society.  The dialogue is consistently hilarious, and there are many darkly humorous moments in the film.  I thought that the scenes with Travolta and Jackson were the movie's strongest points, but the whole thing was good.  I still liked Reservoir Dogs better, though."

Nine years after its released I have finally got a chance to watch it. I probably watched it for the first time now because I probably wouldnt understand it when it first came out. Im 17 and i really liked this crime drama. Quentin Tarantino is brillaint! His imagination of a crime world is breathtaking. This film probably plots out the lifes of actual hitmen. Travolta and Jackson,  2 seemingly careless hitmen just doing their duty. Travoltas adventure with Thurman very exciting and breathtaking. For a hitman travoltas character was a pretty nice guy. Took a girl out for dinner, danced with her, and even saved her life from a drug overdose. Sadly, Travolta's character comes to a how do you say with out spoiling this...... a tragic moment. Willis's character, was sharp and smart. He plays a boxer who is on the run from a crime boss (Ving Rhames)for killing a boxer in a match. Willis stupid foreign wife forgets willis precious watch which was up his dad's rectum for 7 years and then given to his friend after he was killed and then gaven to his son. Willis then gets into a pretty disgusting and strange confrentation with a bunch of weirdos at a gun shop. Willis though does get himself out of trouble by helping that certain crime boss.... from a bit of a embarrising life memory. Willis does another great performance in another Great film. Now Jackson probably had the most noblelest role of the whole film. A hit man, partners with travolta's character who is only trying to do his job. Even a person who worships the lord himself. Jackson gets into a couple of frenzy in the films. One when his partner accidentally blows some kids brains out in the back of his car and must have the body taken care of and the car cleaned. And the other, is a robbery happening at a restaurant. TIm Roths character is amazingly changed and shut up'd by jacksons character. Though Jackson stoppeD tim roths character from being mr bad boy robber, to mr scared straight robber. Jackson does though let roth keep the money from all the victims. What a great guy huh????? This is film is indeed Pulpilicous. I give this film a 5 out of a possible 5."

Because it is something we have never seen before and will never see again. The film itself is a work of art, and I think all those involved knew it. Tarantino uses wide lenses, steady cams, and track shots to capture the films actors, locations, and the raw emotion surrounding them. Pulp isn't told in chronological order, which actually improves the telling of the three stories and how they interconnect. Each of the actors gives a stellar, out-of-this-world, easily the best performances of their careers. What makes Pulp Fiction so great is the dialogue. These people talk about things that anyone would talk about on an ordinary day. A perfect example of this is Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta. They begin talking about differences between Europe and the US, then move right on to talk about how they should have guns to take out the people up in an apartment, then talk about TV. Bruce Willis gives easily the best performance of his career as Butch the Boxer. And who could forget Christopher Walken, who will forever be remembered for his speech about Butch's gold watch. Pulp will forever be quoted by people and kids in school yards for its memorable lines, such as: "Aww man, I shot Marvin in the face", "Your dad had this watch up his ass for five years, and he died of dysentery", "Royale with cheese", and "The spider caught himself a couple of flies."

In the hands of another director, this would have been labeled garbage, but since this is Quentin Tarantino(the god of hype) it's praised. I just don't get it. I actually enjoyed Jackie Brown much more. Never once have I been so dissapointed by a critically praised movie in my life. It had everything that I like in a movie-guns, drugs, language, violence, and Samuel L. Jackson but failed...miserably. I hope this review goes on top, because every other person has been brainwashed into thinking this is a cinematic masterpiece. People listen: do not follow the hype and come out and say how terrible this movie actually is. Don't worry the film critics aren't going to attack you or anything, just speak your mind on how bad this movie really is. 1 out of 10 stars."

Both John Travolta and Sam L. Jackson, put on an outstanding performance. Pulp Fiction also has the best dialog i have ever heard in a movie. Even though this movie comes out as a series film, the script is surprisingly funny.Another good characteristic of this movie is that it is shown out of order, this makes the movie a lot better because the stories begin to overlap each other, explaining things that arn't explained the first time it is shown. Their are also a lot of good cameos/co-starts in this movie such as Bruce Willice, Uma Thurman, Harvey Kitel, Tim Roth, Christopher Walkens, and Steve Buscemi although the movie is very violent and has a lot of profanity, it is a movie you can watch and enjoy over and over again."

A must watch for anyone who likes movies, or the art of movie making or the art of story telling. The most impressive are the cast and the story which has unforgettable opening and closing scenes.Adding to this is the fabulous guitar when the starting titles come on. Loved the movie from beginning to end. The Uma Thurman and Travolta dance is not to be missed. This is a wonderful and hilarious way of depicting the LA crime scene and Hit men activities. Very raw and straightforward way of story telling with in your face explicit language which adds to the real feel of the movie."

It starts out in a diner where a man and a woman (Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer) discuss armed robberies. The story is then broken off into three distinct strands: the date between a hit man (John Travolta) and his boss's wife (Uma Thurman), an over-the-hill boxer (Bruce Willis) on the run, and the clean-up of a hit man's mistake. The film returns to the diner scene for its ending sequence.If you saw Quentin Tarantino's first (and better) film, RESERVOIR DOGS, you should have no problem following the events of PULP FICTION, which are not told in chronological order.The performances in the film are outstanding, namely by John Travolta, who shines as tough guy hit man, Vincent Vega. Samuel L. Jackson is equally brilliant as Vince's partner, Jules Winfield, who reads a bible passage before he kills his next unsuspecting victim.Another strong point in the film was the good writing, which was also strong in RESERVOIR DOGS.Despite the fact that the film produces one of the grossest scenes I have ever witnessed in a film and a slow-moving middle, PULP FICTION still remains a damn good film, snubbed by the Academy when Oscar time rolled around in 1995. Samuel L. Jackson was well deserving of an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. The film did win an Oscar for Best Screenplay, although. GRADE: A-"

Unfortunately for them, they decide to rob the coffee shop were our main characters are enjoying their coffee and breakfast, Vincent and Jules, who are themselves hit men for a powerful gangster, Marcellus Wallace.And so the story develops, bouncing from different times to different characters we see how each event affects everything else. Character development is a major part in the film. You feel empathy for the characters, whatever those feelings may be, you understand the motives behind their actions.Complete with a Christopher Walken monologue that he has become famous for and brilliant performances from Samuel Jackson, Bruce Willis and John Travolta, comedic scenes that you'll be reiterating afterwards and graphic scenes that will keep you up afterwards, this movie is a must for everyone."

Good dialogue is for TV and theatre. Good action and story are what counts. Pulp has plenty of both. It will be interesting to see if Mr. Quentin can reinvent himself. I must say, the people who tried to copy him failed badly.One problem when you have carte blanche with the cut and the budget for a movie. There isn't anybody there saying, "get rid of thirty minutes of mean looks and endless yapping and we'll distrubute it."I fear the movie will not hold up over the generations because of its' ridiculous length.Travolta, Raymes, Willis and the babe et al were superb.

Jackson and Travolta were excellent. I will always think twice about pawn shops--seeing as how some may have the Gimp tied up in the basement. My only question is what was the glowing content(s) in that all important briefcase Jules carried around?

Most modern-day efforts are made up of scattered plot points and cheesy popular culture, which leaves viewers with a hollow, bored feeling.(This applies only to serious movie-goers) But every once in a while, a film comes along that has characters that work so effectively that it literally consumes your thoughts and emotions. One such film, is Pulp Fiction. The plot of this film will totally envelope your interests and eventually bring you to a point of understanding why the characters do what they do.The cast of this film is one of the most impressive that I have ever seen. Everyone(down to the smallest player)in this film is a recognizible Hollywood actor/actress. And each of the personas are remarkably believable. What I mean by this is that when you see Vincent Vega on screen,(mobster; Travolta's character) you don't see John Travolta performing as the character Vincent Vega, you see Vincent Vega. The same goes for the rest of the cast.The soundtrack is another high-note for this film. The music for this film sets the mood perfectly for every scene of this masterpiece. From the Spanish sounding, Tango inspired "Miserloo" beginning to the soulful sounds of Al Green's "Let's Stay Together" permeating in the barroom scene, this film's soundtrack soars high over any big orchestra crescendo.The story takes place in L.A., one of the most crime-ridden cities known to man. The story surrounds two hitmen, two disgruntled bank robbers, a crime boss and his wife, and a burned out boxer at the end of his career.I would love to blabber on about what happens in this brilliant indie film, but I wouldn't want to ruin it for anyone who has yet to see it. All I can do as a faithful servant of the cinema is to highly recommend this film to all film-goers. It is quite a long film that is broken into chapters, so if you find it hard to follow the movie "Memento" (which I also highly suggest)you should just watch this movie several more times and pay closer attention!!! Please, do yourself the favor of a lifetime and see this movie!"

How hard is it to show someone getting their brains blown out of their butts 50 times per second and write dialogue based solely on one word four letters long beginning with the letter F. That combined with repeated use of the "n" word?  Come on, you people should be outraged at such a racist film.  That alone should be enough.Now, I've only seen the clippings, and not the entire film from start to finish, I'll admit.  And I know that a lot of you are saying, "Emperor, how do you know that you hate this movie if you haven't seen the whole thing?"  Well, I've never been drawn and quartered, either.  You see, I thought clippings were supposed to make you WANT to see a movie.  And the ones I saw for this movie turned me off to it.Mr. Tarantino, you don't NEED to find new and creative ways to kill someone, or use the "f" word every three seconds to make a great film.  In fact, the ones that keep that stuff to a minimum are usually the ones that do the best at the box office.  No, I'm not saying that you should make everything all happy and perfect and "Leave it to Beaver-"esque, because things should be believable on film.  However, what is real is NOT always a depressing drag.  Why don't you just TRY this idea and see if I'm not right?Also, if you're in doubt as to what will work for a particular scene, project, etc., just check your W.W.E.D. (What Would Emperor Do?) bracelet.As far as rating goes, on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being the worst and 10 being the best, I give this movie a -5.

There's really not much to say about this movie, except the fact that it's awesome, or is there...? Superb casting and nice, good direction from Tarantino is a real pleasure to watch. John Travolta's and Samuel L. Jackson's characters, hit men Vince and Jules, are funny yes, but they also make you think. The speech of Jules in the end of the movie is in my opinion at least a speech against violence. "And I am the tyranny of evil men" he says a gun in his hand pointing it at "the weak".The real pleasure of Pulp Fiction is that you are watching a movie that really comes. A movie that is in no way extraordinary really, but is left in your mind basically through the time you stay alive. And of course it set the course of good crime movies. Tarantino's screenplay also is amazing. It's nice to see characters talking as they really would once..."

Pulp Fiction connects the intersecting story lines of Los Angeles mobsters, fringe players, small-time criminals, and a mysterious briefcase.Tarantino's twist on the pulp genre is also damn near a work of art. His passion is for storytelling that allows the most outrageous characters to reveal their feelings in long takes and torrents of words, poetic and profane.One suggestion,don't just watch the movie,listen to it to see the beauty of it.Pulp Fiction was always a film that asked more questions that it answered. Until now.Every one of us is different with our different values,cultures and choices and at times we tend to watch a movie which we like and which can suit us.For instance,you may love romcoms but not a crime drama like pulp fiction.So ever felt that you want to know the list of best romcoms in different years.Then www.flickstree.com is the best platform for you.Now stop searching for the movies in different sites and blogs.Simply log in to find out interesting movies to watch!Highly recommended!"

People say Pulp Fiction has the most violence.  I can't disagree more.  Pulp Fiction has very little violence and people should look at the movie as a brilliant piece of art and not as a violent movie.  Tarantino did an outstanding job at bringing a not that complex story and everyday dialogue to the screen in one of the most enjoyable films ever.  On top of the brilliant story and writing, there are the performances.  To start, Samuel L. Jackson gives the best performance I have ever seen on screen as Jules The Hitman.  His performance is memorible and some of the things he says and does is unforgettable.  Harvey Keitel is just as impressive as The Wolf.  The scene with Keitel, Jackson, Travolita and Tarantino in Jimmy's house is classic.  Pulp Fiction ranks among the best movies ever made and for good reason cause it is an absolute great movie and should be cherished for years to come and I hope everyone gets an opportunity to see this movie.  The dialogue is great and the way Tarantino split a basic story into 3 different parts is amazing.  **** out of 4 stars for Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction"

Sign in to vote.,"one of the most important films of all time","I just recently finished watching pulp fiction for what seems like the millionth time and I thought that I'd share some of my thoughts and feelings about this timeless piece of film. This is my favorite film of all time. It ranks right up on my top ten. Every time i sit down and watch this movie, I lose track of time and I'm sucked into this fictional world. There are a million things that I love about this film. First there's the story structure. Tarantino loves to turn his movies upside down and inside out. He follows a non linear story telling structure. Some people dont like this form of storytelling. For me I think it's a good idea that I usually dont see that often in movies. The dialogue in pulp gets fresher and fresher after each viewing. The reason why i think it does this is because most movies i see have the same type of dialogue. So when i see a movie like this it still seems new to me. A conversation about fast food before the hitmen go to kill off some guys usually doesnt occur in movies. Tarantino knew this when he wrote it and is very original. Another thing I love is the camera. It seems like it is a character in and of itself. I also like the actors in this film. I just wish i could step into their shoes and experience the world through their eyes. My favorite of all of them is Sam "the man" Jackson. His character is very well developed. The dialogue that he is given becomes somewhat of an entity. Upon many viewings I caught different things I had not noticed from before. One example of this is in the opening sequence. When I saw it for the first time on dvd I caught john travoltas charcter walking to the bathroom while pumpkin and honey bunny are talking. That and many other scenes just get better and better each time i see it. By the end of the year I'll probably have had watched it for the trillionth time. When I have kids of my own I will show them this masterpiece. And by the time im old decrepped and in a retirement home I will have seen it to an eternity. Pulp Fiction is by far one of my favorite films and it should be seen by anyone who likes film."

It was good, but the solution to the problem was simple, but totally avoidable problems is what made the movie 3 hours long.)It's like Terrantino made the movie, chopped it up, then just tossed the scenes down in no particular order. You HAD to watch this movie twice to get the full effect. ALL the actors were good with their roles (Including the one who was ripped.

But then after watching it four or five times, it was actually pretty good. I bought it because it was said to be one of the best films ever made, and it had great actors in it like John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Bruce Willis and Christopher Walken. But when I watched it was very disappointed. I thought it was really stupid, and there was no plot to it. But then I watched it a couple more times, and I could see why a lot of people liked it. The main plot to it is the story of two hit-men (Travolta and Jackson). In the movie there are four different stories about these hit-men and there amazing adventures. This movie won the an Academy Award for The Best Oringinal Screenplay. So if you want to see a fairly entertaining movie watch Pulp Fiction. If you would like to see a better film by Quentin Tarantino (Director of Pulp Fiction), see Jackie Brown. I would say it is much more entertaining."

"Forrest Gump", "GoodFellas", and "Fargo", all came close, but none measure up to this Tarantino classic. Everything in this movie is as good as it gets. The screenplay is amazing, winning "Pulp" it's ONLY acadamy award of 1994. Most all of the awards it should have won were stolen away by one of my earlier mentioned, honorable mentions for best 90's film "Forrest Gump" which truly is a classic, but isn't on the level of "Pulp". Overall, the script is marvoulsly written and put together by Tarantino and Avary.The acting spawned numerous acadamy award nominations, but suprisingly didn't win any. Samuel L. Jackson definetly gives a worthy performance as the bible quoting, "N" word saying hit man Jules that changes his thoughts about his career after what he calls a divine intervention. John Travalto proves he truly is the comeback kid  also earning a nomination for his Elvis-Man,Vicent, type hitman who gets blown away in the bathroom, but still appears in the end of the film, because of how the script is written. (For some reason Tarantino makes all of his characters in all of his movies wind up in the bathroom to create interesting situations. Roth and Bushemi in "Dogs". Jackson, Thurman, and Travolta in "Pulp", and, well, I don't remember one in "Jackie Brown". Oh Well, No Matter.) Bruce Willis is particularly fun and powerful as Butch in the seen where he stumbles into the wrong store at the wrong time. Along side him is Ving Rhames in an equally powerful performance as Marcellus Wallace. Uma Thurman plays Mia, Mea, however you spell it, the wife of Marcellas, who, when unable to handle a hit,is ran around all over every where, leading up to a highly intense adrenaline shot seen. Christopher Walken makes a funny cameo, Harvey Kietel does, too. Even Tarantino himself makes a cameo as Jimmy. All in all, all the suprising twists and turns, and breathtaking action/violence make "Pulp Fiction an instant classic!"

6,24-Aug-01,jamesmccrae,0,1,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"One of the VERY best","This film is violent and i can see how people can find it shocking, or whatever... But, I've been raised on TV/film violence (I'm 19) and don't care much.So, anyway, this film is one of the best films I have seen, easily. Firstly, Tarantino wrote and directed.  You can see that he has talent in abundance! Second, the cast is great.  Even though these people are not the sort you are likely to favour in the real-world, there is only one character (Butch's wife) that i don't like. John Travolta shows that he is a good actor (contrary to some of the s**t he's done, and is literally ideal as Vincent.  Samuel L. Jackson is particularly cool, the afro's a dream too! Ving Rhames, Harvey Keitell also stand out as the best of a very fine bunch. Christopher Walken is amazing.  You only see him tell a five minute story, but in that time he earns himself 10 oscars worth! I can go on forever about the characters and cast, but i won't. The dialogue is the most entertaining i've ever heard in a film, a sheer pleaure to the ears.  But the quality of the people will complement the words big-time. The soundtrack is also, yes, you guessed it... very, very good.  It makes me like songs I would most probably never listen to.  Jungle Boogie's my favourite. The other MAJOR asset of this movie is the non-linear story telling.  Ontop of everything else, it makes this movie stand out as quite possibly the best movie of the 90s. It is everything about this film makes it so incredibly good, not to mention strikingly individual.  The cast is a stellar gathering, the story is seriously entertaining, not to mention highly funny throughout the bulk. And the way in which it is told is intelligently captivating, the soundtrack is also a BIG bonus, complementing what you see magnificently. If a fairly seasoned film-watcher of my age does not like this film, he (or she) must have a more innocent, less demented mind than I!  But I like films such as this, my other favourite is a real oddball- Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. I can't sing it's praises enough."

Tarantino weaves his stories together in a brilliant fashion.  The film has sometimes been criticized for being to violent even though most of the violence is done offscreen, with elements of humour. It is a twisted entertaining thrill ride that will keep you (sorry for the cliche) on the edge of your seat for the entire 2 1/2 hours.  There's never a dull moment.  The dialogue is witty and clever, the humor is twisted and it is the best film I have ever seen.

But he let me down with this movie. The first time I saw it, I left the theatre after 10 minutes. Than so many people said that it was great movie, I went again and saw the whole movie. And I still think it's bad movie.In thru out the movie Travolta ,the most overrated actor alive, is sweating ten litres of sweat an hour and that for a "cool" guy. John's acting can't even be compensated by the always great Mr. Jackson and Uma Thurman. When Travolta is saying the f-word, it has the same impact as when your grandmother of 89 years old is saying the f-word. Iam not a fan of Bruce Willis, but in this movie he is really good. The camera action is, as always with Tarantino, excellent.But with the script Iam really disappointed. It lacks that extra thing that Taratino can give. The script feels like it consists of leftover stories, and I don't mean the three main stories(Travolta&Jackson, Willis and Roth$Plummer). Making the story a house of cards."

The conversational bits in Quentin Tarantino's epic "Pulp Fiction" are among the best ever filmed and have not only filled up movie quote books, but have become a part of pop culture. The genius writer/director behind the indie hit "Reservoir Dogs" decided to present the film out of chronological order, and the result is the audience actually <i> concentrating <i>, and attempting to understand the order in which the events are placed. The performances are really great as well (remember, most of the movie is dialogue-driven, so the actors really had a chance to show off with these awesome lines).Now you may be wondering why I consider this the best film of the 90's. Here's why. "Pulp Fiction" was innovative, intelligent, and inspired a whole new generation of films (as bad as some of them were): the "cool" movie. Loads and loads of movies attempted to copycat "Pulp Fiction"'s very unique style and perfectly written dialogue, yet none of them did. "Pulp Fiction" is one of a kind.Yes, the movie deserves it's "R" rating, but if you're watching it to find something to complain about, then don't watch it at all. "Pulp Fiction" is for an audience that doesn't mind to be challenged. If you absolutely can't stand REALLY bad content, then don't watch it. For the rest of us, this is the coolest movie ever. "A+""

Sign in to vote.,"A look into the mind of gangsters","When I first heard the beginning conversation of this movie, I knew this movie would have truth to it. Now, I'm not a gangster, but I'm pretty sure that killers don't just talk about killing and crime. They probably have normal conversations, like they do in the other amazing Quinten Tarantino movie, Reservoir Dogs. Unlike movies like The Godfather, they make mobsters look like all they know is "the family", and all they can talk about is "the family".But what also came through in this movie is Samuel L. Jackson's role when speaks about a Eziekel 25 verse 17. Cold blooded killers are not so cold blooded. People might not think that these kind of people read the bible. Characters in movies like Joe Peschi in "Casino" distort the ideas people get about gangsters. Even if the line Jackson recites in a violent one, he would have to read the bible to discover it."

I thought it was just pointless trendy pap.  However, once I got older, and more into this kind of film... I viewed again and realized what I missed before.  This film is a modern classic in every way, shape and form.  The dialogue is untouchable... so many memorable lines, Tarantino actually makes profanity sound like poetry.  I'm sure everybody knows the plot of the film by now, so I won't get into that.  It's just one of those genuine, unique original pieces of cinema that will never be forgotten.  I just have to say, if you haven't seen "Pulp Fiction", go and see it, now!  You won't regret it.  There is lots of profanity, but come on people... it's just words, and it sounds beautiful.  The violence isn't quite as bad as its sometimes made out to be.  Highly reccomended for anyone, even the kiddies!"

Is it the best film of the 90's?  Not quite.  I'd put Saving Private Ryan above it, but that's the only film that I can of at the moment (admittedly, I haven't seen Schindler's List).  In fact, Private Ryan is the only movie that I can think of AT ALL that is better.  It's easily one best fims of all time.  Tarantino's dialogue is absolutely brilliant, the best written that I've heard in a movie so far.  The acting is incredible, as is the direction.  Well, you get the idea.  It's awesome. If you haven't seen it, get off of your computer and go to Blockbuster of whererver and rent it!  You won't regret it.My score: 9.5 out of 10NOTE: While it's an awesome movie, I should note that it's also filled with objectional stuff.  The F-word is used well over 200 times, as are many other profanities.  The violence is graphic and brutal.  There's also a brief, almost totally off-screen homosexual rape scene.  Yeah, it's not for kids.  But still, if you can stomach all of that stuff (as can I), you'll love Pulp Fiction."

Under it´s delusive external surface you can find great irony. Tarantino shows us every possible kinds of repulsive characters and ugly situations. Satire certainly isn´t an easy genre: neither for creators nor for audience. Everything you see in this marvellous film is opposite of the purpose. Where Tarantino aims to, is to make fun of the vanity of violent action films. The movie treats current problems in film-making: superficiality and distorted values. We are entitled to get a good laugh in Pulp Fiction many times, but why? Enjoying the endless cruelties? No. Because of the discriminating critic against immorality? Yes."

Queutin, the director, is a genius. the theme of love and redemption was presented in such a moving way.  the 3(or 4) seem to be independent, while they are inter-related. the chronical order of narration was broken apart and replaced by a confused disarrangement. in the second scene, jules shot a man down for his boss and then the movie turned to the fourth secene when jules and vincent were already in their boss' place. only at the end of moive, the skipped part of jules' redemption, the main theme of the film, was presented on the screen. why this?? the period of the rougly 3hours of the film is simply indicating the whole long process of jules' salvation. the magic bullets inspired jules of god's love that persuaded him to put the pistol aside in the restaurant and quit the gangs life(he did do so, for in the latter part he didn't show again); however. in contrary, vincent didn't realize this and stayed in, thus he was killed by potch just like a tomato that failed to catch up getting smashed up and becoming ketchup! this movie deserves such a reputation and is worth reviewing hundreds of times. thankx, Queutin!"

Them: "Yeah, yeah.  I saw that in high school, it was funny.  But did you see Shawshank?!"Thus, in the above episode, "Them" has placed him or herself squarely within the group of people who do not understand.This is the first movie that everyone my age saw, besides maybe "Planes, Trains, and Automobiles," that made you believe in its profound relevance no matter what it did.  Two characters discuss MacDonalds in Europe, and you believe.  A woman traces a visible rectangle in thin air with her fingers, and you don't know why, but you believe.  The confidence of the dialogue, perhaps, or the sublimely offhanded complexity of the plot.It also features career-making performance from every one of its actors. This is the movie that defined comeback with John Travolta, and that defined Samuel L. Jackson in the first place.  Uma Thurman could walk off the screen and you wouldn't notice.  Bruce Willis makes you realize who Bruce Willis really is.  And in a Tarantino tradition foreshadowed by "True Romance," Christopher Walken's one scene is achingly nuanced and hilarious, the closest thing I know of to perfect.Pulp Fiction is simply the most important and best movie of the 1990's and, therefore, since the 70's.  If you haven't seen it and you're older than 16, you must must do so, right now.And I like Shawshank a lot, by the way."

I'm not in the right generation to have loved this movie from when it first came out, but I watched my first Tarantino movie with a friend, and it was Resevior Dogs of all things.  I admit that this man is a movie genious - the plotlines to both RD and PF are so awesome that they actually leave me thinking - unlike most movies.In both movies, plots are great, characters are great, actors are great, direction is great, and I can't seem to find anything wrong, at all, about either of these movies.  Throwing himself into the movie as a character, Tarantino's acting was awesome and I'd love to personally thank the man for this movie if I could.  I love the story intervention of Pulp Fiction - they all just connect and at the end of the movie you just go "ahhhh! I get it!". I love it.  I would suggest this movie to anyone who wants to see any talent in movies, and if the DVD wasn't due back tomorrow I'd watch this over and over and over.  I'm sure I'll buy it when I can conjure up the money because there is nothing I love more than a movie you can watch multiple times.I'd put this in my top three list, the other two movies being "Resevior Dogs" and "A Clockwork Orange".  I haven't even said anything about those, but they'd get better reviews than even this beast of a movie.  I love it, you should rent/buy it, because only a doofus can not like this movie.

I thought I might faint, even.The dialogue of 'Pulp Fiction' is made up of the most interesting, eclectic conversations you might ever hear.The soundtrack elicits emotion barely surpassed by the heroin scenes.The scene organization sets an all-time prescedent.The plot is only fantastically compelling.Comparing films from 1994 to 1944 films is not fair, especially in the current social context.

Sign in to vote.,"Inventive and thoroughly original modern classic","The fact that Pulp Fiction has inspired so many wannabe crime spectaculars is a testament to its originality, which, in a close finish, is the greatest aspect of this film.  It surprised me with its tangents of craziness and fascinating characters, and rarely have I found a recent movie that I have wanted to view repeatedly to pick up the little aspects of.  The film, amazingly, makes you forget the surrounding factors (such as the bloodshed, the suburban drug-grubbing LA area, etc.) and makes you focus on the characters and the dialogue.Some have considered Pulp Fiction a superficially ambiguous film, with throwaway diatribes and few new comments on crime life from writer-director Quentin Tarantino's first stark film, Reservoir Dogs (1992).  True, Pulp Fiction does feature a lot of the same features as Reservoir Dogs, such as the gunfights and the sometimes gratuitous brutality, but to me, Tarantino is putting a new spin on well-worn filmic stories. The plot is split through three interlocking and weaving stories, and upon the end of the first viewing of the film, you find yourself saying, "Now I remember how he got there!"  It gives the mind an added gift to toss around when considering the film's plot.Specifically, the high quality of acting stems straight from the dialogue, which (as I'm sure I've said) stands out at film's end.  The most accomplished and varied ensemble cast in recent memory all contribute performances that suck you invariably in to the scene being portrayed, with exceptional performances by the reborn John Travolta, the intriguing and searching Samuel L. Jackson, and the always bloody Bruce Willis.  As most of us know (and some who have been doing so), the screenplay is quoted in pop culture ad nauseum; how, I ask, do lines like "This is a tasty burger!" become useful in everyday life besides the daily trips to Wendy's?  This stands as another testament to the staying power of the dialogue, which ranges from joyful banter and gossip (the black-Samoan Antoine's predicament of being thrown from a window) to absolute lunacy (the famed "Le Big Mac" conversation, which borders on SNL skit material).  You laugh, and at the same time, throw up your hands.In 1992, after the initial release of Reservoir Dogs, Roger Ebert challenged the "obviously talented" Tarantino to make a better film.  He did just that by crafting a film worthy of the Best Picture award in a hotly-contested year for great films (don't forget Forrest Gump and The Shawshank Redemption).  For me, the film lingers in the mind, as you try to understand just why you enjoyed this crazy film.  9/10"

Sign in to vote.,"Dated","I can understand the praise this movie has received (in my experience mostly from the under-30 male population) mostly because of the society into which it was released.  In 1994 film makers, musicians, and artists of every shade were into "pushing-the-envelope" art.  Each generation,as they find their own voice, seems to want to shock the generation that came before it, and my generation chose senseless violence and base language to express their coming of age.In the first place, I believe this type of behaviour is silly, and non-productive.  Secondly, if it is entertaining, it is simply because it seems novel.  I do not herald Tarantino as the next great philosopher...in fact, his subsequent attempts at film making have proven Pulp Fiction to be part of the early nineties phenomenon of transforming violence, language, and sex into cool.  To get moralistic, I doubt if anyone who saw the movie would want the movie to be their reality.  So if you don't want to live it, ask yourself, why do you want to watch it?I have had arguments with people who have loved Pulp Fiction (many of whose opinions on other films I usually agree), and one thing seems to be a mainstay in their laudation of it: it was different, it was the first, it captured the imagination.  However, those kind of movies -- much like the blockbuster action movies of the 80s a la Van Damme, Schwarzenegger, Segal -- have had their time and have passed away from the centre of attention. Pulp Fiction had its chance, but it failed the most enduring test of all...the test of time."

Sign in to vote.,"Overrated, but not worthless","Few movies made in the last five years have inspired such impassioned criticism and intense adulation as Quentin Tarentino's Pulp Fiction. Most viewers either love it or hate it. Only a few folks, like myself, land in the middle ground in their critical view of it.Is Pulp Fiction the best film of the 90's ? Certainly not. Schindler's List, LA Confidential, GoodFellas and Saving Private Ryan should all rank far above it in 90's film retrospective lists it when the decade (as mediocre and uninspired an era of filmmaking as Hollywood has ever seen) is over. All four movies are more coherent and precise in their treatments of their individual subjects. All four pictures are more convincing and all do a better job than Pulp Fiction of balancing their remarkable style with substance.At its best Pulp Fiction is a rollicking, chaotic swirl of color, melodramatic tension and 90's pop iconography. The movie has a wonderfully sharp and stylish look--like a celluloid version of the comic books and cheap novelettes which inspired its story. The editing is brilliant in its quirkiness and unconventionality. The movie jumps from panel to panel with breathtaking intensity, much like a graphic crime novel. The fractured narrative structure of Pulp Fiction keeps the audience off balance: it's a superb touch that allows the movie's narrative twists and turns and visceral images to impact on the viewers.At the same time Pulp Fiction's strengths are also its weaknesses.Too often the movie is "over-stylized" and technical. It's like a brilliant film student's dream picture--too cute and "too cool" in its inventiveness and technical precision. Tarantino's unabashed tribute to pulp novels and movies can be both a joy and a bother to behold. At times, Tarantino's obviousness and lack of subtlety is grating. The movie's dialogue suffers most from this malaise.Those who praise Pulp Fiction's script as "brilliant" ought to run down to their local video store and rent Howard Hawk's The Big Sleep and Roman Polanski's Chinatown. Both scripts are everything that Pulp Fiction TRIES (and fails) to be: funny, quirky, cool, subtle and substantial. Indeed, it is a sad commentary on current society that anyone could Pulp Fiction's muddled screenplay "brilliant" when placed against masterpieces of screenwriting like The Big Sleep.In writing Pulp Fiction's script Quentin Tarentino tried too hard. The screenplay is loaded with lame modern pop cliches and cutesy cultural references. The overly slick script nearly mars the brilliant acting efforts of Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta and others. In light of all of this, the trite theme of redemption that runs through the movie comes across as false and shallow.Nonetheless, Pulp Fiction is still worthwhile viewing. For all of its flaws it succeeds in entertaining the audience. Samuel L. Jackson's performance--a sign of his great talent--alone makes it worth seeing. If viewers take the movie with a grain of salt they should enjoy it. It they want depth or profundity they should look elsewhereRating: 3 out of 5 stars, 81/100."

6,29-Apr-99,Dan-O-4,0,4,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"*YAWN*","I watched this movie only because of all of the unbelievable press it got, albeit years after it came out (April 1999).All I can say is, why was this movie so praised?First, for all the so-called action, it's boring. The whole endless date scene between Travolta and Thurman? The stupid dance contest? Couldn't wait for it to end. And the ending of the date was just as useless.Then the whole long dragged-out sequence with Bruce Willis...I just kept thinking, who cares? Then the senseless rape sequence. It gets worse!Then the whole *hour* it seems we spend in that diner at the end. I don't know, it just didn't do it for me. The accidental shooting bit was ok at first, but then it too got dragged out and boring. Quentin Tarrantino should never again appear in one of his movies. He, quite succinctly, sucks as an actor (and he ain't much of a director, IMHO. He's the one responsible for keeping the movie moving (heh!) and it dra-a-a-a-ags...)To sum up, this is almost three hours of mostly boring crapola punctuated by a few shootings/interesting events and even fewer really funny moments. On the upside, Samuel Jackson's portrayal of a truly terrifying Bible-quotin' gangster was great...up until his "epiphany." He's the only one that deserved an award on this one. I never bought Travolta as a hitman. Thurman is way more sexy in her mind than in fact.All-in-all, an average effort from the Hollywood grist mill, certainly not the earthshattering event it's made out to be. Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels has been described as a PF wannabe, but for my money, LS&2SB is 100% more funny and imaginative, the plot is way better and ties up in much more unexpected ways, and is overall a much better film.And I sat down to watch this movie wanting to like it. Oh well..."

6,30-Nov-04,simpson_fan1000,1,2,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"It was an important Movie for society and one of clever originality.","This movie by Quentin was one of excellent originality. Not only did it display the "other half" of the gangster image, it was also successful in its acting, and clever in certain scenes that I only notices when watching the special features of the 2 disc DVD. This movie is important because it, in a very clever way, SIMULTANEOUSLY portrays gangsters as invincible and vulnerable, witless people. Samuel Jackson and John Travolta wield 45 magnums like a toy gun, murder a number of people in the process, as if they are truly above the law. On the contrary, they are contradictory to the usual gangsters of the past, like the Godfather or Jimmy Hoffa. In these movies, they are seen as godlike and untouchable; idolized in today's society and envied by many inner city citizens. In Pulp Fiction, we are given another look at this "untouchable" image because the two gangsters portrayed here are often sloppy, and occasionally witless. An example is the dismembering of Marvin, the accomplice of Jules and Vincent, which displays Vincent's stupidity. Talking about buying a beer in Paris and hash bars in Amsterdam. Letting Mia Wallace snort 1500 of Choco heroine which, obviously, is not supposed to go into the nose. Not to mention Vincent leaving a silenced on the a counter for Coolidge (Bruce Willis) to find and murder him with. Even Marsellus Wallace (portrayed as an invincible kingpin) is raped by two men.The "time" factor. Most people, when watching the movie, did not realize that in the beginning, you can picture John Travolta walking to the bathroom behind Honeybunny, or Jules talking in the background about eating his muffin (this all happens while Pumpkin is talking about the benefits of robbing a restaurant). When watching the movie several times, it is clever how Tarantino manages to separate each scene and split them up at different moments in time, leaving us small clues that allows to pick apart his cleverness. I'll bet you were confused when they shot the two people (in nice black and white suits) and retrieved the briefcase (after the Bruce Willis piece) they arrive at the bar in t-shirts and short shorts. If you noticed, the bar does not open until noon (or 10am?), if I remember correctly. They arrive at the apartment just short of 7:30 am when they murdered Flock of Seagulls, Brett and the "seinfeld" guy. Marvin is shot and when they arrive at Jimmy's house, it is about 8:20. They are given less than 40 minutes to clean the car, and dispose of the clothes and the body. When the restaurant is robbed, it is approx. 9:27 as displayed in the kitchen where Pumpkin is seen hollering at Hispanic dishwashers. When you notice this; how it was timed and well planned, it is all the more brilliant."Pulp Fiction" also has great irony to it. When they are in the bar, Bruce Willis is done talking to Marsellus Wallace and encounters John travolta. John Travolta Condescends the boxer, referring to him as "palooka" and "punchy". 2/3 through the movie, John Travolta dies at the hands of? Bruce willis by his own weapon. Another irony linked to this is in the apartment when he survives six shots from a 357 magnum! Vincent Vega blows it off while Jules takes it seriously. The same situation occurs in the apartment when Vincent dies and Jules lives because he quits "the life" apparently at the perfect time.Perhaps the most underrated portion of the movie is its music. From Dick Dale and the Del Tones to Kool and the Gang and Al Green, they blend in with the movie. Tarantino did not choose songs that were popular in 1994, but songs that he personally thought did not get credit they deserve. Thanks to excellent editing by Sally Menke, the songs blend into each scene; they do not overpower the scene and distract you from it, but pull you into it, and often have you singing along with it if the song is familiar. Unknown songs are chose and ignored the first time. But when watching this movie again, I appreciated it more because when i really listened to the songs, i found them to be entertainment. The Misirlou at the beginning, in a way, sets the tone of the whole movie. Al green's "Lets Stay Together" is now his most famous song; mellow and fits the scene in which it is played. It is the trademark of all Tarantino's movies. When you watch his other movies, I'll guarantee that the opening song will set the mood for the movie. Kill Bill, and Reservoir Dogs are good examples. When I first watched this movie, I was nine years old. I did not have the ability to apply critical thinking to this movie, until i recently bought this movie on a 2 disc DVD. The interweaving of the plots and an excellent cast have immortalized this movie and made it one to study and analyze for years to come."

No this story has been seriously considered and is nice and complicated. I love the flashbacks and different storylines. And what about the cast??? Especially John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson KICK ASS in this movie!!!Look, you musn't be afraid of some foul language or violence, but it isn't overdone (no violence is really shown on the screen) and they are gangsters after all?! And the scene of Uma Thurman being brought back to life may be much discussed, it all fits in the whole picture of the movie.One of the best things about the movie are the dialogues! Can't be compared with your average film. One of my favourites is the one with Travolta and Jackson in the car, about Vince's stay in Europe.With Pulp Fiction Tarantino proves himself to be an excellent filmmaker! Especially with such a low budget. I can't wait for him to make a movie as great as this one.Conclusion: Pulp Fiction is a MUST SEE (cult-)movie, for everyone who's is open for it. And go see it several times, because I still found out new things about the story after seeing it a couple of times. Try to figure out what everything means!!"

6,20-Nov-13,nagykaroly88,1,2,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"Incredible movie","Outrageously violent, time-twisting, and in love with language, Pulp Fiction was widely considered the most influential American movie of the 1990s. Director and co-screenwriter Quentin Tarantino synthesized such seemingly disparate traditions as the syncopated language of David Mamet; the serious violence of American gangster movies, crime movies, and films noirs mixed up with the wacky violence of cartoons, video games, and Japanese animation; and the fragmented story-telling structures of such experimental classics as Citizen Kane, Rashomon, and La jetée. The Oscar-winning script by Tarantino and Roger Avary intertwines three stories, featuring Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta, in the role that single-handedly reignited his career, as hit men who have philosophical interchanges on such topics as the French names for American fast food products; Bruce Willis as a boxer out of a 1940s B-movie; and such other stalwarts as Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Christopher Walken, Eric Stoltz, Ving Rhames, and Uma Thurman, whose dance sequence with Travolta proved an instant classic."

6,6-Dec-13,marckonno,1,2,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"Best of all time!","Quentin Tarantino is the Jerry Lee Lewis of cinema, a pounding performer who doesn't care if he tears up the piano, as long as everybody is rocking. His new movie "Pulp Fiction" is a comedy about blood, guts, violence, strange sex, drugs, fixed fights, dead body disposal, leather freaks, and a wristwatch that makes a dark journey down through the generations.Seeing this movie last May at the Cannes Film Festival, I knew it was either one of the year's best films, or one of the worst.Tarantino is too gifted a filmmaker to make a boring movie, but he could possibly make a bad one: Like Edward D. Wood Jr., proclaimed the Worst Director of All Time, he's in love with every shot - intoxicated with the very act of making a movie. It's that very lack of caution and introspection that makes "Pulp Fiction" crackle like an ozone generator: Here's a director who's been let loose inside the toy store, and wants to play all night."

Creative plot layout along with actors such as John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson is what makes Pulp Fiction great.  Pulp fiction has an un-sequential time line that won't leave you feeling lost.  Basically you have three different stories throughout. You have Two hit men (Travolta and Jackson), Two Crazy robbers (Amanda Plummer and Tim Roth) and a mentally troubled boxer (Bruce Willis). You will laugh, cringe and be amazed during the over dramatic situations these characters come across.  Weird scenes do arise at times but that's Tarentino's style.  Don't let that give you a bad preconceived judgement. I highly recommend this film to anyone over seventeen."

6,1-Feb-03,JTLoh273,1,3,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"If Quentin Tarantino was a grill man, then his movie Pulp Fiction would be a `Royal with Cheese!'","The movie depicts three different stories all interconnected by the characters involved. The main characters Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta give memorable performances as Jules and Vincent. They play a couple of hip criminals sent by their boss to retrieve his mysterious briefcase. Through out their adventure the audience is shown that the simplest decisions made have direct and sometimes dire consequences on life.Although the three stories involved are shown out of sequence, Tarantino does an excellent job making the scenes flow together. Unlike the recent film `Memento' where event/time can become confusing the audience in `Pulp' is able to easily follow when a scene is taking us back in time to events that preceded other events already shown. One method used by Tarantino to accomplish this is the classic fade to black at the end of a story followed by an introductory title board before a new story.I especially like the acting in `Pulp Fiction.' Tarantino seems to bring out the best in the actors and actresses, including the very small almost minuscule parts. Christopher Walken appears for only 3 minutes, but gives a brilliant performance in which he talks about what he went through to deliver a watch. You want to laugh and cry for what this poor guy went through to deliver this watch. Then there is Harvey Keitel who doesn't appear till nearly the end of the film, yet is able to make a lasting impression on the audience. He plays the cleaner, sent to assist Travolta and Jackson after an unfortunate mishap. He's cool, clam, and smooth, as he sips his coffee, assess the situation, and saves the day. A few other small parts, but with notable performances are given by Amanda Plummer, Tim Roth, and Eric Stoltz.Yes, we all know Tarantino has a love for violence and it is quite present in `Pulp'. However, it's not nearly as overpowering as one might suspect from a Tarantino film. You don't get the sense that Tarantino set out to shock you with the violence, such as the disturbing `ear' scene in `Reservoir Dogs.'Remember as you watch `Pulp' it's the simple choices that later have big outcomes on the lives of the characters. The type of container you choose to store your drugs, could come back to haunt you. A freak event occurs; do you dismiss it, or re evaluate your chosen profession? Could the next tragic event in your life have been avoided if you had only made the decision to watch `Pulp Fiction?' Don't take the chance, watch it, you may be glad you did."

This movie is so amazing, that i based my imdb screen name after the restaurant that uma and john go to together.  In fact, my imdb screen name was gonna be marcellus, but that was already taken.

6,22-Jan-11,JessieTaylor,1,3,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"Pulp Fiction","Pulp Fiction is a phenomenal movie that can never be watched too many times. With each viewing it somehow manages to reveal something new or interesting. Although Pulp Fiction is a violent movie full of blood, drugs, and sexual content, the script is surprisingly comical. I think that is why so many people come to love this movie. It almost brings together all the genres into one movie (comedy, romance, action, etc.).Quentin Tarantino does a really outstanding job of choosing the actors that could put themselves into the characters shoes. Some people say this was one of Tarantino's best films and I have to agree. Although Tarantino has made many creative films Pulp Fiction, in my eyes, rises above them all. I also really love how he intertwines the four different stories about the two mob hit men, a boxer, a gangster's wife, and a pair of diner bandits and then in the end he brings it all together.When comparing Pulp Fiction to another movie I would compare it to the film Sin City. Sin City also tells the story of three different people, all caught up in violent corruption. It also has a very creative plot and story line and the cinematography is outstanding. Both movies are sensational and so different from the normal day to day love story or action film. Both Pulp Fiction and Sin City are excellent to watch and very refreshing if you like artistic movies."

When I select a film that claims to be a drama I want it to be dramatic which means that it is at the very least SERIOUS! This film is utterly frivolous! This film is so light that if it was thrown into the water it would float, even when filled with concrete. Whoever classified this film as a drama is wasting people's time!

My younger sister looks amazingly like Uma Thurman, and when it came to her and the date with Vincent, I just looked at the the screen and pointed and said that I thought she looked just like her, except blonde!! And she was smug enough to tell me that she had heard this from many people! I didn't even know who the heck this actress was. To me, this movie really can't be captured totally at a first viewing. It's kind of a circular film - the first scene is completed by the last scene.I would recommend it for people who don't mind a lot of violence, who LOVE dialogue, and can not take a movie all that seriously.I think it wonderfully cast - John Travolta can still play dumb but smart, Samuel A. Jackson is so intense it's scary, and I loved the handsome Eric Stolz as a drug dealer. In fact, everyone is so good in this little series of different stories that intertwine, that I must say I thought it wonderfully cast, with all the characters very believable.I recently saw it again after many years, and I still say it a very violent movie, a black comedy, and something of an anomaly as far as movies go. It's just cool, what can I say?My boyfriend asked me what part I would like to play if I could have played a part, and I said "Honeybunny." And then I said," Do you want me to call you "Pumpkin?" This isn't a review, it's a comment. I believe this movie to appeal to some, and the rest of you close-minded, uptights that can't take a joke, well, that's your right."

One of the best scences in the movie is the second scene of the movie. Where, John Travolta is talking to Samuel L. Jackson in the car about what they call different burgers in fast food resteraunts in Europe. I thought that was hilarious and a classic. People might of thought the swearing was heavy, but I thought it added a sort of... real tense to the movie. The acting was the best you will see in a while. The performaces by Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, John Travolta, Vingh Rahmes, and Bruce Willis were fantastic. After seeing this movie I knew why it was nominated for Academy Awards including Best Picture. I think Mr. Tarentino introduced a new type of movie, that I wouldn't mind seeing more of. I hope he continues to write movies like this one. It was funny, scary, dramatic, and in its own way romantic. If I were a real critic and my say mattered, I would unanomously make this my favorite movie of all time.

I have seen a lot of comments about the film's morality, but a film should first of all entertain.What I hate about a movie is if it is too predictable you know what is going to happen after 15 minutes or I feel cheated if the plot is too convoluted purely to confuse me. Pulp Fiction does neither of these but just gives you enough changes of pace to keep you guessing how the stories are going to come together.   And how they do!  When you see Vincent and Jules at the diner for the last scene you just KNOW what's going to happen next but Tarantino keeps us dangling with some really funny dialogue about bacon when all  we're waiting for is the inevitable confrontation.This film is a collection of classic scenes and funny one-liners (the adrenalin-shot scene has to be my favourite).  To look at whether this is a moralistic film is the wrong way to look at it.  It's never going to be as uplifting as, say, The Shawshank Redemption, but it never pretends to that kind of film. But it does have depth. After you watch it more than once you start to think of the "What If's"Probably the most profound is the mix of Faith in God versus Faith in Superstition.  When Jules says that he felt the touch of God, was this a true warning to him and would HE have been shot instead of Vincent if he hadn't changed his ways.  Or was God trying to save Pumpkin and Honey Bunny through Jules?  Or was Vincent the one that God was trying to warn but he didn't feel the touch of God and so lost his life and possibly his soul to the Devil.  The briefcase's combination is '666' so there is definite imagery of Hell here.And Butch has Faith in Superstition with the dubious history of the lucky watch. What if he never went back for the watch?  Would he have ever escaped the hitmen looking for him?  And was it the fact that he had just put the lucky watch on that helped him get the better of Vincent?  And what seems like a really unlucky encounter when he runs down Marcellus and then gets taken hostage by the shopkeeper actually gives him probably the only chance to wipe the slate clean by saving Marcellus himself.  So if the watch really was lucky, what more luck could you ask for??A great movie and 10 out of 10 for entertainment (and not just the first time you watch it - tho that was the best for all the surprises)."

6,11-Jan-99,Nav-4,0,1,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"Over the Hill?","When I saw Pulp Fiction 4 years ago, I have to say I was busting out laughing with everyone else in the audience. The vibrant dialogue, the intertwined storylines and unexpected plot twists took me by surprise. I took my girlfriend(now ex-girlfriend) to see Pulp Fiction a few weeks later, and she didn't laugh at any of the funny parts, and definitely took exception to the violence. Of course we got in a big fight over the whole thing in the car ride home. I couldn't believe that anyone with half a liver and a thyroid as their only major organs, could not see the brilliance that Tarrantino had crafted.I watched Pulp Fiction for again since the last time I saw it with my ex, and you know what? I really didn't like it as much. Now much can be said about this reaction. Maybe my ears and eyes began to bleed with the post-Tarrantino melee of knock off culture that ensued after Pulp Fiction. Things that were already cool for twenty years, like Dick Dale, or Kool and the Gang got incessantly beat into our heads as "the new hip thing". Fine, maybe I harbor a little resentment for how the mainstream will eventually water down anything that has any artistic merit. I think I even saw a butter commercial that used that "Pulp Fiction" font as title cards. Gimme a break.Back to the main point. Is Pulp Fiction a great movie? No. Is it good movie because it is entertaining? Yes. Is it an important movie? No. Do I think it isn't an entertaining movie because of the violence and profanity? Quite the contrary, I don't think that has anything to do with whether or not this movie is great or not. Pulp Fiction like myself, is a compost heap of pop-culture references. The Simpsons are a full of pop culture references yet considered great. Shakespeare is full of pop-culture references, but no one gives his work flak just because you have to open the OED to get half of it. I think too many people spend too much time dwelling on these obvious manifestations. I think the real reason Pulp Fiction is not great, is because it does nothing to create characters who are metaphoric in any sense. They are there to serve very one dimensional purposes on the screen. People praise Pulp Fiction for it's structural elements, but for my money Reservoir Dogs or a movie like Short Cuts did a better job of playing with narrative style. This brings me to Reservoir Dogs, which I think is a great and important movie because it did alter the narrative telling in a totally different way. Though much of the story element is ripped off from a similar chinese movie about twelves thieves with an informer and a heist gone bad(I can't remember the name of it), Tarrantino tells the story differently than any filmmaker has told before. Not only is the story non-linear, but if broken down into it's treatment of time, it looks like someone took a script chopped up into pieces, and then taped it back together randomly. Miraculously it all works. He also tells the story like a drama for the stage, with long extended dialogue sequences, but yet he manages to not get that "why did they even bother putting on this film, because it looks exactly like a play" look. (In the Company of Men, Oleanna) Reservoir Dogs has all the violence and profanity of Pulp Fiction, but it also has depth to it's characters.Tarrantino is a well educated filmmaker, in the sense that he knows his film history, and pays homage to great directors like Truffaut and Godard. Is Tarrantino a great director like them? No. In my mind he has made one truly great movie, and couple of good movies, and a couple of duds. Tarrantino might be totally screwed, as he might be scorned for the very style he invented, the next time he comes around the mountain. True no one does Tarrrantino better than he does himself, but do we really need or want it. Maybe that's why he's hanging out on broadway with Marisa Tomei, trying his shot at acting. Which by the way, he sucks at. But you know what, I've never have made a body of work that comes close to what he has managed to accomplish in such a short period of time."

Let me warn any readers now, that some of the reviews you find for this film give it an utter pan. Well, everyone is entitled to an opinion, I suppose.Some decry its obsessive use of profanity -- ever walk down a city street and NOT hear that much cussing? Some bemoan the excessive amount of death and violence and general "no way, that's just not real, could never happen" shenanigans -- they live in pretty neighborhoods, not backstreet *anywhere*.This movie is the treasure it is because of the incredible level of true grime and underbelly it shows in its treatment of the New Gangster. Fair warning! It's not a pretty sight! This movie is for the same person that enjoys the speeding bullet, car-wrecking, general riot and havoc type of film...But that's not all! We also see the return of John Travolta, and the meteoric Samuel Jackson! We hear dialogues that are not about backstory. Because they aren't! They're *real* people, having *real* conversations. And that, my fellows, is one of the fabulous things. We get to go along for a ride with pushers and boxers and law-breakers and murderous rednecks. And that's just the first time you watch it.Wow.PS: This movie also falls under the "Inverse-Bruce" Rule: A lot of Bruce Willis is not so good, but a little Bruce is incredible.PPS: Pulp Fiction: Where it's always 4:20 (unless it's Seven Twenty-Two in the A.M., of course...)"

How could Tarintino better the superb reservoir Dogs, it isn't easy. But with Pulp Fiction he has done it. The acting is out of this world, and the soon to be what ever happened to John Travolta made a magnificent comeback and is now back on form. But the greatest acting comes from the one and only Samuel L Jackson who gives probably the best supporting performance i have ever seen. I've seen a lot of movies including all the classics but this still stays in my mind as the best movie ever made."

Sign in to vote.,"One of the few times I've ever agreed with the religious right","I saw this movie when it first came out in the theater and it really wasn't what I expected.  I saw Reservoir Dogs on tape a few months before and thought it was a pretty interesting-- albeit pretty simple-- little movie. Everybody mentioned the ear-slicing scene.  And while it was a little disturbing, I thought it was done to show the horror of violence or something.  But after watching the *very* similar Pulp Fiction I guess I was misled.  Strangely, nobody who saw Pulp Fiction mentioned how violent it was.  Just how cool and funny it was.  So when I realized that I was part of the very small minority who didn't bust out laughing when one of the characters would off-handedly get raped or blown away, I started thinking that maybe our society really was going downhill.  It just kind of shocked me that not only was it casually accepted by the audience, but that it was also apparently really funny.And I also don't see how flimsy pop culture-laced dialogue makes it such a cool movie.  Maybe if Reality Bites threw in tons of hilarious violence and homosexual rape it'd be lauded as one of the best movies of all time.  I mean, the difference between McDonald's in Holland and America?  That didn't impress anyone after I came back from a trip to Europe, much less millions of movie-going people around the world.  Painfully stretched-out conversations about milkshakes and bacon?  Whether a massage is ever "more than a massage"?  And that part towards the end with Harvey Keitel?  Man, it just drags.  "Get rid of the body and then clean the blood off the car." Wow, ingenious advice.  But he enjoys fine coffee too!  The irony!  He's a hard-ass criminal AND he likes good coffee!If only I filmed all those worthless hours spent talking with my dorky friends in diners.  And then blew some of them away.  While blasting a Barry Manilow song in the background."

It is the best piece of maybe the best director around, Quentin Tarantino.The movie shows several episodes which feature a boxer, two gangsters getting a briefcase, the bosses daughter having an o.d., a gangster pair robbing a restaurant, and through weird coincidences those episodes are all linked, the order is messed around, and there it is.Part of what makes this movie so great are the just incredible dialogues. Tarantino has a truly original style here that you will only find in his other movies or maybe some Rodriguez films. Also, the acting is just extraordinary. Just look at the cast: Samuel l. Jackson, John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Bruce Willis, Tarantino himself...I do believe that everybody ought to see this movie once. I watch about every other month. Ok, there is some violence and one really gory scene and a lot of foul language, not to mention drug use, but that shouldn't stop you from watching it.I highly highly recommend this movie."

He weaves four seperate stories that brilliantly come together. Vincent Vega (John Travolta) is the slightly overweight hitman that has to kill boxer Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) who doublecrossed his boss Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). In another story Vincent and Julius, another hitman, played by Samuel L. Jackson, go on a trip to recover a case of stolen money from a couple of small time gangsters and accidently kill their contact in their car. This is where the Wolfman (Harvey Keitel) comes in and saves the day. In between we see how boxer Butch Coolidge and hitman Vega struggle in everyday life and how Jules is enlightened. This all starts with the robbery of the diner where Jules and Vince discuss religion and saviour and where we meet robbers Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer who are taught a lesson by gangster Jules. Definately a movie to watch and well worth the Oscar"

The plot is so unique that this movie has invented a new gangster genre all its own. This movie leaves no room for boredom. The reason for this is because the plot floats back and forth so much that you stay interested just by trying to understand what is going on. I will admit that it took me two times of watching to fully understand, but after realizing what the movie was about I saw its greatness. If I could sum the movie up in one word it would be ironic. From start to end the humor, the three stories, and the characters themselves, everything in this movie is based on irony. I believe Tarantino's use of irony is the source of his great influence on the genres of today's society."

I'm new to this site (although I've been visiting it for over 2 or 3 years now). And would just like to first off say that a lot of you who are giving over-elaborated reviews of this film - Just stop. This movie doesn't doesn't need to be broken down bit by bit for you to display your love for the film, OK? Anyway..I can't really say anything fresh or new about this film that hasn't already been said in a way before. I recently read a column in Stuff Magazine with B-movie king Roger Corman citing this as one of his all-time favs and that "Pulp Fiction has elements of exploitation films but it adds complexity of character and humor in the mix" which is something thats so true but something I found interesting because I never read someone with the same view on the film. Which is whats so nice about a movie like PF. Like groundbreaking films before it - Slacker, Strangers in Paradise etc. - Its open to all interpretations and they vary from surprising to stupid to what you'd expect and I think thats just great. Moreover, I think I'll quit with this gushing and get going. Thanks to anyone who reads this and May you have a good one!Signed, Parapalygic Dwarf"

Sign in to vote.,"The most Overrated Film in history","After reading the comments for this film, I noticed that there seems to be a lack of intelligent negative criticism directed towards Pulp Fiction.  This is easily the most overrated movie of all time.  I suspect that critics are afraid to publicly criticize certain directors (such as Scorsese or Kubrick), and somehow Quentin Tarantino got added to this "untouchable" list (possibly excluding the painful From Dusk til Dawn series).Pulp Fiction has nothing to endear itself to movie watchers.  It is very mildly humorous, but infrequently.  It is neither focused on the action nor the romance present in the script.  The most common praise I see is that the dialogue is "sharp".  This compliment is ambiguous at best, but is also weak and applies to hundreds of movies, many with much better and more insightful dialogue.Pulp Fiction is a weak entry from a director that seems to garnish undeserved praise from critics everywhere.  I suppose they must have fallen in love with the pricelessly insipid Reservoir Dogs."

Fantastic plot, acting, directing (!), and editing, especially in the modern era of film. Became an instant classic in 1994, and remains to this day a film that others are compared to. Still afraid of pawn shops after all these years. Only ONE Oscar out of seven! Well deserved Best Original Screenplay for Roger Avary and the incomparable Quentin Tarantino. Picture, Director (Tarantino), Actor (Travolta), Supporting Actor (Samuel L. Jackson-shoulda beat Landau, even though he was brilliant as well), Supporting Actress (Thurman) and Editing.

However, the series of events that took place seemed very realistic and I give it 8 stars.  What I mean by that is simple; very well known actors very well acted all of the scenes.  There wasn't a bunch of special effects; pretty much everything you would see could have really happened without any illusions.  I found myself clenching my blanket daring to take another peep at certain points throughout the film.  No, it wasn't scary but definitely weird, weird enough to keep an audience interested.  It deserves special attention in that it is not like any other movie I have ever seen.  I know I'm being very vague about any actual details, but disclosing a small portion of the movie just wouldn't make any sense unless you've already seen it.

Vincent is the bad man, he like his life, drugs, alcohol, parties, women and power! His last name Vega, like Las Vegas he gables with his life. At the ending scene Jules gives Tim Roth some money to safe him, Vincent want to kill him just of principal reasons! Tim Roth is just another human on the way to a criminal lifestyle, but is rescued! Tim Roth is also in Four Rooms (another movie by Quentin) and his girlfriend in Pulp Fiction is the same in Four Rooms, in this movie he has a job, he doesn't like being a clerk, though he is being p***ed on by everybody!I think Wolf is the conscience, the little voice inside your head, Jules supports him in everything he does, Vincent hate him from the minute he sees him! Or is he a midlife phase in their lives where they think thing through, Jules want out and to be clean, Vincent want his old life! In "The Bonnie Situation" Bonnie is a sort of jugdement day, they shall be gone when she arrives, that means that shall have chosen a side. Quentin is a reminder of that jugdement day will come.The suitcase is the temptation with the code 666, everybody who looks at it is captured in its golden shine. Notice that Vincent is the one that gets, carry and delivers the suitcase, Jules doesn't even touches it! Wallace is the devil, he sends Jules and Vincent out for the suitcase, and Vincent delivers it while Jules is on the toilet!Uma Thurman is just a satanic human, Vincent like her because she also live a life full of alcohol and drugs! When she is close to die because of drugs, she have the opportunity to think her life over. She activates her security system by pressing one key three times... 666!Butch is the the angel of death and sometimes also Jesus. His golden watch is very important to him, because if time aren't there no body will die! The part from the Bible that Jules says is Ez. 25,7, it tells about some people who was greedy and eager for vengeance, God killed them with their own weapon (revenge). Vincent only kill people in form of revenge, and as God Butch kill him with his own weapon, remember the one in the kitchen. Wallace also tempts him, he won't die but his power will be taken (Butch's power is pried), just like Satan and Jesus in the desert!Zed and his friend represents the thousands years where the angel of death, devil and his men will suffer in pain, untill God releases them for some time, after this they will all be thrown is a lake of magma. At first Butch is the angel of death, he suffers, then he returns to release him, just like God.The title Pulp Fiction describes that its something that always will be there and you can't do anything about it. Okay, almost nothing, you can believe in God for a start! The movie take place in Los Angeles, can that mean anything?Well that is what I've found out of this brilliant movie! But why does it jump in time?"

And that's exactly what it is. Some bullsh*t stories about hired assassins, bondage,...and some real hard language :p This movie doesn't need character backgrounds or depth in the dialogues, what it needs is exactly what it's got. I'm sure we all talk about our pasts or some philosophical sh*t when we're with our colleague on the way to work, especially when our work is wacking people. Or maybe we need some flashbacks of Vincent Vega's youth to understand his profession...like he got abused by his daddy or something. Come on...and as for the acting and the direction: are you guys blind? The shot when they come out of the elevator, down the hallway to the door, to the back of the hallway, back to the door. That's like a 5 minute shot about a footmassage, it's godd*mn brilliant! That is definitely not bad acting nor bad directing. Although I have to admit there are far better directors than Tarantino. He'll never get to the Kubrick or so level but he gets the job done. And a very nice one too."

It's not a regular gangster movie because it shows you that gangsters are not always serious and dangerous like in every other gangster/mob movie. 'Pulp Fiction' shows you that also gangsters are regular people by making stupid mistakes and chit-chats that you and I could make. The conversations about a 'footmassage' and 'the charmes of a pig' are examples of the chit-chats that makes the movie on a differently way funny. But there are much more things what makes 'Pulp Fiction' a high standard movie. I just recommend you to watch it and to get convinced by the 'Tarantino' elements in the movie.

Sign in to vote.,""How do specific cinematic and dramatic elements bring out the literary elements (plot, setting, characterization, theme) of the film?"","In this movie, "Pulp Fiction," different cinematic and literary elements were used to bring out the literary elements of the movie.  The director, Quentin Tarantino, did an excellent job of using different camera techniques and also drama techniques in order to make the story line stand out.  I believe that this is one of the best movies of all time, and this was accomplished through the use of cinematic and dramatic elements. When using the camera to express the plot, setting, theme, etc., the director performed many different actions.  There was an abundance of point of view shots and dolly shots.  In the scene where "Marvin gets shot in the face," there is a point of view shot from Marvin's perspective and it shows John Travolta's character turned around facing the camera while sitting in the passenger seat of a car.  The camera uses this shot to show the objects in the front windshield moving and makes clear that the setting is in an automobile.  Another point of view shot that shows significance to the story is when Bruce Willis's character comes back to his house to get his watch and finds a gun on the counter.  When he sees the gun, the camera turns to the point of view shot where Bruce Willis's character is focusing on the weapon.  This shows that the gun has a significance and the scene becomes dangerous.  It thickens the plot of the story greatly.  The director also uses dolly shots to express the mood of the story.  When John Travolta's character and Uma Therman's character are dancing the twist, there is a dolly shot that moves around the characters in a circle.  This gives the effect that the camera and cameraman themselves are dancing.  The dance and dolly shots give off a positive mood and lighten up the movie right before it drops into Uma Thermans overdose. Quentin Tarantino also used many dramatic elements in order to advance the plot and setting.  John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson's characters have a certain attitude radiating off of them even when they do not have any dialogue.  Their suits match as hit men and they both have extreme hair styles.  These dramatic elements bring out their characters and make a connection with the audience.  The director also uses music to set the mood of the movie.  While doing the twist, there is pleasant music to portray the mood as happy and there is no danger for the characters. The director did not only advance the plot with the story line, but he also used dramatic and cinematic elements."

Sign in to vote.,"Tarantino's world-creation",""Pulp Fiction" will stand as an example of the creative, life-embracing potential of cinema for generations. Tarantino has succeeded in relating a "fiction" to an audience that has perhaps expected something else: the relation of a set of "facts" in their taken-for-granted context. Tarantino has powerfully understood the potentially authoritarian position lent to a filmmaker with an audience that demands such simplicity, such servitude. The director of "Pulp Fiction" has not delivered a linear, appeasing plot or characters. He has, in a sense, created a world in which situations are not easily rendered in a series of simple cause-effect relationships. The chapters of his story come as he wishes to give them; this is ultimately an act of respect for his audience, allowing them to enter his world and imagine the possibility of their own creations.Elements of this film remind me of Gary Walkow's 1995 film "Notes from Underground", based on the Dostoevsky novel, which is, fortunately coming to DVD in September. The Underground Man in the story cannot but view his life through a lens; this self-consciousness undermines his humanity and creative possibilities. Walkow's brilliance is reflected in the act of effectively turning the camera on his audience, holding up a relentless mirror to society and its inevitable product: a completely sick, dehumanized, alienated individual. Tarantino combats the mundanity of this alienation in his film "Pulp Fiction" through his ability to relate a "fiction", seeing it ultimately for what it is: his own creation, which he can change and manipulate as he pleases. Both "Notes" and "Pulp" come highly recommended; they each invite the viewer to embrace his or her own agency."

6,17-Nov-12,jonathanmoens,0,1,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"Pulp Fiction","A brilliant film. Tarantino uses a simplistic technique for allowing his characters to evolve and reveal themselves, yet it is the context in which he puts them (and by context not only do I mean the scene, but the relation dynamics between other characters in the scene) that allows him to create deeply interesting, powerful and generally entertaining characters. All with their own idiosyncrasies, and often alluding humorously to societal stereotypes he creates a reality, which so often transcends upon us in the mundane of our societies. Tarantino demonstrates movies should be just as much about the verbal aesthetics rather than the visual through his eclectic dialogues, and the way many of his characters are founded upon an accent and a specific manner of speech (diction etc). Arguably, in our contemporary societies, the quality of dialogue (and verbal elements generally) has begun to diminish as a result of our new technologies and obsession with visual effects. Pulp Fiction, for me, is a way of returning to my real understanding of good films: a sophisticated fusion of excellent visuals, plot and (let's not forget) dialogue."

In the world of cinema, however, Tarantino's film has been heavily influential; changing the language of American cinema in the 90's and onwards. Even today, PF's influences are everywhere. More than likely, you've seen homages to this film in many of the more recent films you see, without even knowing it.It's not hard to see why the film was (and still is) as popular and highly regarded as it came to be. It's hip, to say the least. The dialogue is hip, the characters are hip, the cinematic technique is hip. Though what PF has that other "hip" films don't, is a freshness. It's a relief from the standards and conventions of what cinema seems to have become. Tarantino tried to defy the laws of making a Hollywood picture, all while maintaining enormous commercial success.Pulp Fiction tells us four different stories. It follows two hit-men, a mobsters wife, a champion boxer, and two diner robbers. Their stories are intertwined out of typical chronological order.Tarantino's writing is absolute genius. He seamlessly moves in and out of story lines, weaving back and forth in time. It's never confusing, and relentlessly entertaining. Though much of the film consists of long stretches of character conversation (most of which has nothing to do with the plot), the dialogue is so realistically written that we get caught up inside of it. Silent observers of two people engaging one another. Tarantino's Oscar was well deserved.The cinematic technique is also quite fresh. The photography is close, gritty, and unflinching. The lighting is gloomy, and reflects a kind of magazine like feel (the film is inspired by pulp magazines). Tarantino pulls away from action, allowing us to observe all that is going on, but gets up close and personal during conversation, allowing us both viewpoints.The cast is superb. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson play the hit men and strangely enough have a great chemistry. Their breakfast conversation is brilliant. Uma Thurman plays the mobsters wife, and though her part is short, it's quite excellent. Bruce Willis plays our boxer, and has the most demented story in the film, but he was great as usual. Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer are the robbers, who make their presence known despite their very short screen time. Other cast member include: Harvey Keitel, Ving Rhames, Eric Stoltz, Christopher Walken and Quentin Tarantino himself. The casting is stellar.I honestly cannot think of any flaws whatsoever. It works as a black comedy (and boy is it hilarious), a crime thriller, as well as having something slightly profound about it, though the film says nothing. It doesn't need to say anything; it's pure cinematic perfection. It's one of the greatest American films of all time.So, again, it's hard to say what about Pulp Fiction affects me personally. I appreciate it as a film milestone, but I also have a ton of fun watching it. It doesn't seem to get old. Though the film doesn't really have anything to say, it penetrated our culture in an interesting way. I think one could say that Pulp Fiction was the defining film of the 90's. Its influence still reverberates, even to this very day.Someone once called it a boy movie; it's not. It's a film lover's movie. It's entertainment at it's purest and most joyously crafted form.Maybe that's what it has to say. Maybe it's just there to remind us how perfectly visceral and downright fun cinema can be."They call it a royale with cheese." 10/10"

Sign in to vote.,"Pulp Fiction Review","Pulp Fiction is a dark comedy, which means the audience empathizes with the victims who are suffering while the comedy is used to mock the victim and belittle them throughout the course of his or her suffering. This is evident in the films eclectic dialogue, a mix of humor with violence. The small criminals or Los Angeles mobsters carry a mystery briefcase and use many conversations throughout the movie. Language used in the movie shows the sense of humor they share and the perspective they have on life. It emphasizes on blood, violence, strange sex, drugs, fixed fights, dead body disposal, and (leather) freaks. The movie also uses narrative techniques that do not follow an intended pattern, and the movie is out of chronological order; each storyline focuses on a different series of incidents. In the movie, there was a part where Vincent gets prepared to stick a needle in a woman's chest who is suffering from an overdose. Stoltz freaks out and does not want to stick her with the syringe, so he tells Vincent to do it, because he took her. Vince hesitates for a little bit, talks back and forth with other characters, and then stabs the women in the chest, and she arises. Scenes like this make it a black comedy. In the odd movie film, it is a seemingly complete narrative, in which is chopped into pieces and rearranged like a puzzle. A gangster film has no police officers in it. It is a montage of bizarre characters, from a black mobster with a mysterious bandage on the back of his baldhead, to hillbilly sexual perverts, to a mob problem solver. There is a shot reverse cut used in the film to show the audience that the drug dealer was watching television and then, we see the TV, while showing the audience what he was watching. The film also used match on action when the car heads to the house, car goes out of scene, and then we can hear the car crash. The drug dealer comes out of the house and looks to see what happened, while the camera is showing us his vision, we then see what he sees, the car crashed in the side of the house, that is when the audience confirms what the crash was. There were quite a few techniques used in the film, I chose to highlight the adrenaline scene. I believe the editing found in the movie were appropriate because the cuts were not the greatest and in the end it ties the film together. The low keying lighting was perfect. The sound in the film went well with the current scene of action. The background music would set the mood using Al Green, Kool and the Gang, and Ricky Nelson. There is also music that gives personality and creates moods to the characters and film frames. I believe the sound choices used were effective for this movie. It assisted with enhancing the movie. The cinematography used supports the mood of the scene. In movie used many close-up scenes. One scene that sticks in mind is when Samuel L. Jackson is sucking through a straw. The scene builds tension because he is staring at Brad while sipping the drink, and his eyes are off the camera. It builds momentum for the audience knowing there will be a shot out or death coming soon. The camera is eye level with Jackson and the lighting reflects an image in his pupil. The films art is set up in a way to heighten scenes. There is humor, tension, violence, and graphic scenes that can be obscene. The social environment of the movie shows a pattern of events that do not typically happen. Vincent and Mia get up for a dance contest during dinnertime at a restaurant. Mia makes Vincent join her in the dancing. There is also a part when Marsellus and Butch's chase leads them to a pawnshop and Gimp and Marsellus gets sodomized, which is how the turn of events in Pulp fiction happen. There is a form of racism and violence in the social context. This lead into unexpected events from the story line that can distract some viewers because some of things that happen in the movie cannot be resolved and contradicts a resolution for the problem. The story has multiple stories making it hard to look for a straight story. The purpose of the film is to combine every type of film created into one movie. There is a bit of everything in the film, which created a film movement, and not as film story. There was a different narrative and visual technique used to convey the meaning of the film the qualities of these two traits created an artwork. I personally enjoyed the film after learning more about the world of film. I watched it one time and did not like it because I could not follow it. Now I understand the social themes through the mise-en-scene used in the film. I did not enjoy the movie until I could better understand it. This movie will now be on my list of movies to recommend. I will only recommend this movie to people who are open minded due to the racism and violence that takes place."

The writing is spectacular and memorable down to every last word, the characters are unique and interesting while all still remaining grounded, and the cinematography and music help create some of the most memorable scenes in film history.With one of the greatest directors ever working with some of the best actors of the 90's playing career defining roles, it's easy to recognize how this film keeps its place as a monumental shift in the significance of films and their purpose as entertainment."

As soon as 'Misrlou' started playing during the introduction, I knew this was gonna be one bad ass movie! The direction and amazing acting from the cast made this hit not only a Thriller, but also a Comedy even though it was not intended!Another reason why this movie is a beast is because it has an amazing soundtrack! And that played a really important factorThe only thing I didn't appreciate much about the movie is the need for a multiple of plots and stories. But hey, I can't question the direction!The movie does contain many memorable quotes and I'm pretty sure this movie will still be remembered even after a 100 years!At the end, I'd recommend this as a must watch for anyone who likes bad ass mafia movies!Acting: 9/10 Plot : 7/10 Soundtrack: 10/10!

Some of the movies can give you strength and make you feel hopeful. They are full of messages but there are some movies, which are just the opposite. They cause a violent feeling within you. After watching those movies you may say to yourself 'wow! what did I see?' 'That is so vicious!' or something similar.It is obvious that I am referring to Pulp Fiction to the second type. I am sure everyone must be shocked by the way the film progressed. The executions, drug consumption, the lifestyles of thugs, conversations etc. are shown in such a raw way that it will make you think for days about the movie and make you say to yourself 'shit! what did I see?'. The movie gave no explicit messages and just had shown lifestyles of certain kind of people. But this no-message story, is shown in such raw and real way that it will make you see and think about this movie again and again."

There is nothing in this passage that refers to the "tyranny of evil men", "charity", or "finders of lost children". Great speech, but as in many films, the facts get lost in the editing. I'm not sure why the writers selected this passage. I believe others could have been more relevant and could have been written in with less "poetic license". Nevertheless, here is a King James version of the real Ezekiel 25:17 "And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes; and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall lay my vengeance upon them.""

Sign in to vote.,"Super holiday entertainment loaded with visual and spiritual meaning.","Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) to Peter (Tom Holland): "The problem is you trying to live two different lives. The longer you do it, the more dangerous it becomes!"Notwithstanding the "home" in the title, the exciting new Spider-Man: No Way Home is more about the existential need to create one's own identity, the Christian need to give up a life in order to gain it, and the human need for a second chance. Many super-hero movies continue to emphasize the hero's need to recover a parent or child even more than the need to sacrifice for the good of humankind.As Peter Parker (Tom Holland) struggles with the attention he gets because Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal) revealed his identity, he gets involved with Dr. Strange to erase his super-hero identity from everyone's memory. Fooling with Mother Nature never is good in these hyper-active fantasies, and it's true as Peter tries to get Dr. Strange to reverse his initial memory-erasing spell in order to remain in the minds of those he loves.Besides, what director Jon Watts and his writers are really interested in is pulling the three Spidies together (Holland, Andrew Garfield, Tobey Maguire) to remediate former bad boys like The Sandman (Thomas Hayden Church), Doc Ock (Alfred Molina), Electro (Jamie Foxx), and Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe). Dr. Strange clears the way between parallel dimensions to let each Spidey's version of villains to come together for their cleansing.The imaginative and entertaining concept of getting these characters together proves not to be confusing but revealing of their generous natures and the benign fraternity of Spider-Men, adding the collaboration motif into their otherwise solitary lives.Although the digital gymnastics are impressive, beyond those is an attempt to flesh out character for both good and bad boys. Discoveries abound without super sentimentality or long exposition. Because the filmmakers have taken care to load meaning into most dialogue, the revealing third act takes the plot to dizzying heights while character spills out along the way.As more is found out about the heroes and the villains, the long road back to normalcy for Peter seems just about right, filled as it is with triumphs that come from working as a team (not a normal Spidey thing to do) to suffering the loss of dear ones to a better cause. It's a coming of age at any age and a satisfying display of character development that might be envied by indie films everywhere whose bread and butter is a similar attempt to show humans at their worst and best.Super holiday fare, yes; challenging, yes; amazed I am that comic-book stuff holds meaning amidst its visual splendor, yes."

I just don't think MJ adds anything to the story - Ned, the goofy friend is more entertaining. Cumberbatch is great, of course, as Dr Strange, but there's no way he would get outsmarted in any way by a teenager. And why, so he and his friends can go to the college of their choice? I understand that a kid would be stupid enough to want that, but Dr Strange would never say yes to that.But again, ignore the plot device and focus on the graphics - superb!"

Sign in to vote.,"Fun multiversal mayhem that plays on nostalgia and callbacks.","After the effect on his friends when Spider-Man's true identity is revealed, Peter Parker goes to Stephen Strange for help, but the spell has dire consequences.Picking up just where the last one left off, Marvel cinematic universe fans rejoice, even longtime comics Spidey fans may enjoy. Both fans original Spider-Man trilogy and of the two Amazing Spider-Man films get closure. Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire reprise their roles, albeit they matured which is reflected wonderfully in where they are as their spidermen. They give Tom Holland's Peter advice, at times humorous, but offers there characters redemption and resolve.Director Jon Watts delivers a well directed spectacular outing, despite some continuity (mostly editing issues). Watts, writers Chris McKenna andErik Sommer achieve the seemingly impossible, by creating a coherent story while shoehorning in all three Spider-Man's and more villains than you can shake a stick at. Credit to the casting director for getting Jamie Foxx, Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, Rhys Ifans and Thomas Haden Church back on screen respectively. If de-aging effects are used, they're pretty seamless. What is impressive is that all the actors are on fine form and get enough screen time and story beats so nobody feels short changed. Lead Holland, Zendaya's memorable M. J. and supporting cast including J. K. Simmons, Benedict Cumberbatch , Jacob Batalon, Jon Favreau and Benedict Wong to name a few slot in nicely.There are plenty of multiverse spells, well-staged action sets ups and shenanigans, but the reason it arguably surpasses many of the bloated, overlong Marvel outings, is its emotional core. Holland and company never lose sight of what makes Peter so likeable and vulnerable. This carries over from the Spider-Men counterparts and offers plenty of emotional clouts, not just in terms of doing the right thing but in the high stakes storyline and the sucker-punch of Aunt May's fate mirroring Uncle Ben's demise.While we don't get the inclusion of Nicholas Hammond's Peter Parker/Spider-Man; there is a nod to his Spider-Man in the closing, with the classic comic suit design. Tom Hardy welcomingly appears as Eddie Brock / Venom in a talk of the town, head-scratching mid-credits scene at a bar. The after credit scene sets up Dr Strange 2 and connects to the 'What if...' series and has little to do with the Spider-Man character.Overall, despite some fridge logic, it's fun, but it's the memorable multiversal mayhem that plays on nostalgia and comic callbacks, that defines this Spider-Man outing as opposed to a Spidey film. It makes you feel anything is possible, maybe we'll even get an 80's Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends live-action one day."

Sign in to vote.,"Multi-verse has been with us for a while","Multi-verse started when Andrew Garfield took over the Spider-man franchise from Tobey Maguire, to start a new trilogy. I am not talking about the comic book sci-fi multi-verse, but the real-world cinematic multi-verse. Bringing in 5 of the best villains from previous Spider-Man movies is a double-layered realization of the concept of multi-verse.If you have read some of the critics' reviews, you would probably gather that this movie is s minefield of spoilers. I'll try to tread carefully in the trailer-revealed zone, which means that I cannot really say much that is meaningful."No way home" picks up directly from where "Far from home" left off, with Spider-man's real identity, Peter Parker (Tom Holland), revealed to the world. The entire plotline hinges on Peter's endeavor to undo this, which only gets things from bad to worse. At Peter's besieging, Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) undertakes to cast a spell to make the world completely forget that someone by the name of Peter Parker ever existed, let alone knowing that this individual is Spider-man. All would be well (except for Peter, who voluntarily accepts this solution), but for Peter's incessant interruption, DURING the course of the spell-casting. He wants the good Dr. To make an exception of MJ, or Michelle Jones (Zendaya), then Ned (Jacob Batalon), then Aunt May (Marisa Tomei). The consequence is catastrophic. That the spell fails to work is small matter. The catastrophe is that it ends up opening a portal for villains in the multiverse to come to our world.The first 80 minutes of the movie takes us through this mayhem, through which Peter wants to "cure" these villains, rather than letting Strange send them back to die. Our hero is such a Good Samaritan that he goes to the extent of successfully exiling Strange temporarily to stop him from interfering. The tone and mood changes somewhat for the final hour of the movie, with the arrival of the other two Pater Parkers (as mentioned in my opening paragraph), bringing with them even more levity but also a measure of poignancy. From here on I am just going to assume that the reader has a degree of familiarity with the two previous trilogies. In fact, the more you remember, the more you will enjoy No Way Home.But first to the 5 villains (Jamie Foxx, Williem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, Thomas Haden Church, Rhys Ifans), an ensemble of elite actors who have among them 1 Oscar win, 6 Oscar nominations and countless other wins and nominations. The screen time and weight given to these 5, however, are in fact quite different. I feel sorry for poor Ifans, whose face is all but recognizable in a human lizard, and truly appears for a couple of seconds after he is "cured". And it is highly doubtful if anybody remembers him, as I did, where he was a co-star in "Enduring Love" (2004), the movie that sort of debut Daniel Craig's acting ability after having been around for some time.While we are on acting ability, after Far From Home, the general reaction to Zendaya's performance, while approving, would be that she has really high bench-marks impossible to meet. The two previous MJ's, Kirsten Dunst and Emma Stone (whose character Gwen Stacey Spider-man 2 refers to, in this movie, as "my MJ"), are respectively Cannes and Oscar Best Actresses. No Way Home is testimony to Zendaya being right there with her two predecessors.As I mentioned, the more you remember about the two previous Spider-man trilogies, the more you would enjoy this one. When Andrew Garfield's Spider-man 2 laments that he is not up to par, the other two encourage him "you are amazing". Remembering that the title of Garfield's trilogy is "The amazing Spider-man" will doubtless bring a smile to your face. On the poignancy front, there is a scene when Tom Holland's Spider-man 3 failed to cash Michelle Jones from a lethal fall. Andrew Garfield's Spider-man 2 came to the rescue and caught her just in time. While we were cheering, we notice tears swelling in Garfield's eyes, and recall that he wasn't so lunch in his part of multi-verse in catching "my MJ" Gwen. With Tobey Maguire, it was of course the emotionally charged moment of bringing back the immortal "with great power comes great responsibility".The ultimate joy in watching No Way Home is in seeing the three generations of Spider-man bantering, commiserating, and ultimately bonding. Long live multiverse!"

Sign in to vote.,"Trying to resolve the issues","Extremely entertaining but I need some questions resolved before I can really get behind this movie. (Gosh, I miss when IMDb had message boards, so you all could share your thoughts...!)Spoilers for Spider-Man AND other MCU properties to follow....A lot of people are trying to make sense of how Doctor Strange misspoke about what actually happened to all the villains who appear in this movie (which ones died, which ones died fighting Spider-Man, which ones knew Spider-Man's identity, etc.). Clearly more characters came in than just ones who died fighting Spider-Man, and the way I "head-canon" all this is by surmising that the ending of Loki (the streaming show) must also have a bearing here. I mean, how can it not? I know the ending of Loki is technically a breakage of the timeline, but in a way that's one type of multiversal enabler, and it seems very strange to me that the MCU would have both, unless one weakened the stability of reality and the flow of time, to make way for the other.I'm also trying to figure out, exactly what was the spell at the end? For one thing, we have to convince ourselves it was necessary, even though the multiversal cracks in the sky sure seemed to have calmed down already. But what did the spell accomplish? If it only caused people to forget both Peter Parker and Spider-Man, was it just forgetting the shared experiences, or was it forgetting the entire existence of both? And what happened to all the evidence (videos, newscasts, social media posts, etc.) that confirmed the identity? Were those erased too? When the Avengers would have remembered fighting alongside Spider-Man, do they have a complete memory block that he was present, or is his face just amorphous in their minds now?Those are my biggest questions, among many, story-wise. But I also have a production question. When they were editing this movie, why did they leave so much dead air? There are a lot of awkward silences, and I don't know if they were trying to leave space for audience reactions to die down (like the cast of a play will do) or if they were embracing the current popularity of cringe comedy (of which I'm not a fan). This was a detractor for me, to really get into the film."

There were a few woke moments that kind of pander to minorities which is a bit of an insult to the audience.Zendaya's performance was wooden the entire time.Tom Holland is pretty good.And spoiler alert the actors we are all hoping for that were in it were by far the best part of this movie, the entire audience cheered.Zendaya's character should've died but they need to fit the woke quota, but other than that I loved this movie!"

Don't get spoiled by social media, news articles or your so called friends, or by reading reviews like this one, but see and experience this one as soon as possible. DO IT!Because this is the best Spider-Man movie of all time, and it amazingly can be compared to such massive MCU classics like Infinity War and Endgame, and it definitely is the best 4th phase MCU movie/series. Let me tell you why (contains spoilers)."I am all the Jedi", said someone in one of the other popular franchises. Well, here, they bring together all the Spider-Men from 2000's cinema. And boy, oh boy do they deliver. Tobey is back, Andrew is back, and they both are ridiculously good and are given ridiculously good lines and action. Andy G rather surprisingly(?) steals the show the most. So much mushy love around the three spideys, that you will need tissues or cybernetic retinal not to weep your eyes out.The old villains are back, with a vengeance, and better that ever. Doc Oc, Electro, Sandman, Lizard and Green Goblin. Especially the Willem Dafoe chews every scene he is in.If the old cast shines, so does Tom Holland, Zendaya, Jacob Batalon and Cumberbatch. Holland has to use all of his range of emotions, and does it very well. Holland's Peter Parker finally has to go through his Uncle Ben -moment and rise again to become a real Spider-Man.The amount of fan service in No Way Home is uncountable. It's so full of easter eggs that I fear the next Easter is cancelled, because Feige and co. Used them all. But thanks!Cinematically Jon Watts gives us the most beautifully shot and staged Marvel-show thus far. Even if most of the vistas presented are probably generated in a nerdy basement, the composition and use of angles and camera is masterful both in quieter and action-full scenes.The movie makes you laugh, gasp, cheer, weep and just watch in awe. What an achievement, after numerous superhero movies they can still pull this off. And its not Stark and MCU they rely on, its Spider-Man lore where this movie finds its strenghts.And yeah, stay for the two end-credit scenes."

The first movie that I remember having a passion for was Spider-Man (2002). Something about all of the Spider-Man movies featuring Tobey McGuire and Andrew Garfield held a place in my heart in a way that Tom Holland's character didn't.I may be one of the only people that really liked TASM 2 but nonetheless when they cancelled the series after they hinted to the sinister six with the gentleman in the post credits scene, the 13 year old me was devastated. To see Garfield back along with Tobey fighting somewhat upgraded versions of their past foes brought everything full circle. The humor was great, (obvious lines but still funny) and to have the original Jamison voicing over most of the action and the Charlie Cox appearance was the cherry on top. I could go on all day about every tidbit I enjoyed about seeing Tobey and Andrew back but I'll leave it at this.The movie left Tom facing an uncertain future without his aunt and no one in the world knowing who he is. The post credits scenes did not give much insight into what's next for Spider-Man except for the symbiote drop from Tom Hardy before he got sucked back into his own reality. While this tells us that Tom will be up against (or be consumed by) a symbiote in his next movie, 1) I wish they kept Hardy in the picture because he does great as Eddie Brock and 2) this isn't a lot to go off of. Also, instead of the Madness in the Multiverse teaser at the end, I wish they got a little bit more of Charlie Cox into it. The trailer was something they could have released alongside the movie but I'm just nitpicking at this point.In the future, it seems like we are going to be seeing an all-new, reinvented Peter Parker in his college years. This could be promising because (in my opinion), Tom's Spider-Man has had too much of a whimpy tone and this is the perfect opportunity to turn him into a more confident version of himself. I have never been a fan of MJ's character because she just doesn't fit the role (of MJ) for me but I'm excited to see if they bring her back or have Tom move on with his life. Judging by the last interaction in the movie, it kind of gave me the gist that Tom may have accepted that they don't know him anymore and will move on.This was a fantastic movie, especially for the homers that have been Spider-Man fans for the long haul. The ultimate fan's service."

Sign in to vote.,"A Spider CU's Messy Fan Feast.","Aside from the rushed "pre-paid" 10s and 9s, the quality of the film should not mainly be based on the stunning visuals but also on the plot, screenplay and acting skills which clearly fails to hold itself together.Starting with the "Only in Theaters" bs, which I feel is quite outdated, pretty much like the suits behind the industry itself, to ancient that they don't know we are living in the digital era as the new way of life! Why force people to either free stream or the typical silliness of the theater experience, being stuck among people talking, phones peeping, bad seats, extremely loud sound, unable to pause or rewind...etc.Not to mention the contagious threat when you can enjoy your experience wherever you wish digitally! The only reason I see it is for the rich company to get more rich. The option for digitally streaming and theaters should be available from day 1.About the movie itself...Playing on being a Spidey's CU fan fest with the multiverse concept the film can hold itself for being interesting yet it can't hide the fact that the plot is forced and the directing is average with lots of moderate fighting scenes.Silly as it may sound but if you only saw any trailer you practically have seen most of the film by now. The plot is messy and forced and the screenplay feels inconsistent and awkward at points, mainly to force lead the plot into the multiverse situation, don't get me wrong, I do respect the homage and as a matter of fact most of my rating is based on it but my eyes never glow whenever I see a rendered 3D scene like most, the human factor play a lot in my count."

Unable to cope with the fallout he calls upon Stephen Strange to help undo the damage, but when the multiverse is undone by his meddling, the dangers for Parker grow exponentially. Big, bold, exceedingly ambitious take on the titular superhero is slow going at first, then kicks into gear with a multitude of clever in-jokes and self-referential winks at the camera, amusing jabs at the court of public opinion, energetic action scenes, and more laugh-out loud moments than can be counted. Lots of little interwoven goodies for fans to look forward to, plus a wave of nostalgia and a surprising amount of emotional gravity make this more impactful than the recent MCU fare, headlined by Holland and some invaluable co-stars. ***"

Sign in to vote.,"A treat for Spider-Man and Marvel Fans Everywhere","This review will not contain any spoilers, except what was already shown in trailers.I friggin' loved this movie. In my opinion, this is easily one of the best Spider-Man movies ever made, and easily one of the best MCU movies.Director Jon Watts and writers Chris McKenna & Erik Sommers clearly understand Spider-Man. The action and spectacle is wonderful, and the story manages to keep a heartfelt and emotional core. And the moments of Fan-Service are delivered flawlessly. The first half of the movie isn't groundbreaking, but the second half is easily one of the most fun and exciting theater experiences I have ever had. The first half is good, but the second half is literally perfect.Performances were fantastic all around. This is easily Tom Holland's best outing as Peter Parker, Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr. Strange is excellent as well. Jacob Batalon and Zendaya do well as Ned and MJ respectively, and there are very strong performances from returning villains like Alfred Molina's Doc Ock and Jamie Foxx's Electro.However, the standout of the film is without a doubt Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin. If you thought he was insane in Spider-Man 2002 (Which is was) then you will be blown away by his performance in this film. He manages to somehow take his near-perfect character portrayal from nearly 20 years ago and make it better. Truly impressive.Like every other MCU film, the technical aspects are top-notch. The VFX look incredible, and this movie has some of the most creative and exciting action sequences in a Marvel film since "Doctor Strange." Michael Giacchino's score is excellent like the previous two films, and the little nods and winks to fans are scattered throughout brilliantly."Spider-Man: No Way Home" is easily in my Top 5 movies of 2021, and is an explosive, emotional, hilarious, and action-packed love letter to Spider-Man fans everywhere. It's astounding that it managed to live up to the hype and even surpass it. Big congrats to Jon Watts, Chris McKenna & Erik Sommers, the Entire Cast, and everyone involved with this incredible film. (Except Avi Arad)Like almost every other movie, it isn't perfect, but it delivered just about everything a Spider-Man film should. 10/10."

The dialogues & interactions are cringey, the technical execution is bland for the most part, camerawork is meh, editing during the action sequences is awful, visual effects are poor for a $200 million blockbuster and Michael Giacchino's score is also serviceable at best.Overall, Spider-Man: No Way Home gives the old & new fans exactly what they came looking for and makes for a thoroughly enjoyable & entertaining extravaganza that will please most viewers if not all. There are some emotionally resonant moments that definitely stand out & elevate the ride but there was also room for plenty of improvement in several areas. One of the better entries in the MCU canon, this grand reunion of three generations is a must for every Spider-Man fan out there."

After watching No way home I realized my life and the Peter Parker's life has come to full circle.This is one of the best Spiderman / superhero movie made over the Years. Story, Screenplay, Acting, Music, VFX. All the departments have done their job well.It's a unimaginable vision brought to fruition."

Marvel comics is use to turning personal stories into epic events but for me that's strange for the movies.It does work better for the design of these Spider-Man movies, simple because spider-man is perfectly design for those personal stories. In this case it was one of the biggest crisis Peter Parker had to face when one of Spider-Man's biggest enemies J. Jonah Jameson (think about it) reveals to the world that he's spider-man. The event has Parker taking on personal issues that come with the reveal as Spider-man comes under criminal allocations (forcing him to need a lawyer (wink, wink), and his fame as the web swinging Avenger is divided, by those who love him and those who hate him. All this, not only messing up his life but the lives of those closet to him so he does a Marvel team up with Dr. Strange to change all that."

I'll explain some of them that were really obvious because if I get into everything the review will have the size of an essay. I'm not going to throw spoilers here. Anyways, Altruism is a misunderstood word because as people we do what we do to sometimes seem good no matter what if we are or not. Our world never needed a sacrifice or an idol but people who are willing to help our world for the best without caring about their reputation and their legacy. The fight between good and evil is classical but very important because the thought and the physical world doesn't exist without duality and the ending explains the whole purpose. So the prime of the movie meaning, between all the others, was how heroic and selfless/ anti - egotistical is to help people, save lives while remaining anonymous. I'm gonna leave to that because as I said before I don't want to spoil anything. It's definitely a must - watch."

Maybe wipe the sweaty fog from your glasses thats been accumulating since you bought 7 tickets a month ago. I assure you if you do, you'll see a very different movie than the one you reviewed. One with a convoluted story that is, at best, hard to follow, and at its worst, BLOATED with fan service of the cheapest kind. This movie tried very hard to be nostalgic and emotional and totally fell flat on its face. Emotional scenes were well acted but with no contextual weight. The rest of the acting in this was a total campfest. There were some humorous moments but not nearly enough to give this movie a second star. I know marvel fans love anything that comes out even if its horrible, so this review is for people who actually are interested in formulating their own opinions instead of denying a movie is bad because youve been sweating in your sleep about it since the first trailer dropped."

They made his character be the biggest cry baby, a whiny little child who literally messes everything up and his faults, no matter how much damage he causes, literally become his missions. And what I mean by that is he's just too soft. It always looks like he's about to cry, after I don't know how many movies now that he's been in his voice still hasn't gotten deeper so he hasn't grown up at all he's still just a child even in real life. And I know he's supposed to be in high school and his movies which they lucked out and he basically stayed young long enough in all his movies to play the part, but I am so annoyed by these movies that I literally had to shut this movie off 20 minutes into it because like I said he was great in The Avengers Infinity War and Endgame, and in Captain America Civil War, but his own movies are literally for an audience of 7-8 year olds."

(All puns intended)","This will be a non- spoiler review so feel free to read it all.Experience: The cinema was cheering and howling from the very beginning, I had a similar reaction. The number of people in the cinema was about 70-75 or more than that. The cinema's response on every scene was fantastic, everybody was weeping and crying and laughing and hooping and what not. As expected. Throughout the movie I laughed, I cried, sometimes both, and my tears blended, my face whole wet with tears. Even when the credits were rolling I wasn't sitting there with that heart pulse, I was impressed and just lost and in awe of how good this movie was.Summary: This movie felt like an authentic Spiderman movie, it was funny, exciting, action-packed. It takes its time, It feels like a pure Spiderman with the themes. It chooses to explore the stakes and the consequences from beginning to end. It does have that Endgame quality where you're like "Wow, they are doing something big" It rectifies the previous Tom Holland movies with confidence. And with hard decision-making. This, to me, felt like the most authentic Spiderman/Peter Parker movie I've seen in a long time.Tom Holland's Performance: This is easily Tom's best performance. He is freaking fantastic in this movie, he's incredible.What to expect: This is a Spiderman movie that will give you certain things that you want and also some things that are challenging and that hurt. Whether that be in emotional aspect or even in action. In a way, I don't know if it's only me but some action scenes felt more like violence than action in some cases. I was swept up in this.Plot: It was darker than the trailers led on, It's way more emotional. I'm in awe of how I got much more than I expected, it's full of surprises from beginning to end. Even after hearing certain things on how they will go plot-wise. Watching the execution was much more surprising in that regard..Execution: As a huge Spiderman fan, It went through every single issue I've had with Spiderman in comics or even in general. I've read some Spiderman comics too. The movie did it in a way that felt smooth and plotted out in a way that it feels that Its plot and story and drama are written over the last 10 years. It gave me Spiderman that felt so true to its character and it felt like it fits with what we've had with Tom Holland.Visuals: INCREDIBLE visuals, the way they executed it, throughout the number of beautiful visuals and even in the fight scenes, its something spectacular. Puns intended.Direction: John Watson's direction in this is fire. He learned style. There is tension throughout this movie, there's emotion, there's beautiful scene work, the visuals, everything about this is fantastic chef kiss.The Score: Incredible score, soundtracks, the composition, full of emotions and bad-ass music. Overall incredible.Sinister Six: I personally think Green Goblin Is the best in this movie, absolutely fantastic. He was better in this movie than he was in the first movie. He's so menacing, so insidious, and overall such a great performance. The movie establishes the character better than I've ever seen in the live-action. With lizard and sandman, it felt two-dimensional, they lost some three-dimensional stuff that you would hope for. They still kept the three-dimensional stuff with Electro and Doc Ock. But the one that stood out the most was Green Goblin. They make specific and certain choices they make with Sandman and Lizard that I wasn't too fond of, can't go into details as to why. There were certain parts where I was like "I don't know why they chose to do it like that but okay". But overall all of them were enjoyable to watch, and a nostalgic trip back to the 2000's.Rating: This is easily the best Spiderman movie I've seen after Tobey's Spiderman trilogy and Andrew's TASM 1 and 2. A solid 9.5/10 from me."

But do they all justify themselves and did the new film need to be based on past events? The previous movie ended with everyone knowing about the true owner of the Spider-Man costume. Did it have a good effect on Peter Parker? I don't think so, because he began to be pushed from all sides, such a revelation greatly influenced the hero's friends and aunt.. Because of this, Peter dropped his hands and went for help. Then, because of a mistake, everything went downhill and events took on the scale of multi Universes and other spider-men. The plot is fascinating, and the appearance of heroes from other time intervals and Universes pleased the eye. How."

Sign in to vote.,"Whedon Anonymous","Joss Whedon's "The Avengers" opens with the arrival of Loki (Tom Hiddleson), Norse God of Mischief, on the planet Earth. Here he encounters Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), leader of a superhero law enforcement agency. This introductory sequence is designed to show off both Loki's ruthlessness and the manly coolness of Nick Fury, but it achieves neither. It's an over-long sequence, filled with bad CGI and second-rate action.The film then offers a series of vignettes in which Fury assembles a group of superheroes, including Captain America (Chris Evans), Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). Their task? Stop Loki and his giant CGI army. The problem? All these superheroes are too busy bickering to band together, organise and efficiently kick butt.Your typical Whedon tale centres on a Scooby Doo gangs of likable heroes ("Serenity", "Firefly", "Buffy The Vampire Slayer", "The Astonishing X-Men" etc) and ends with a hero sacrificially dying for the greater good. Whedon's heroes are also never able to prevail without a little help from their buddies, and there is always some tension between being the sole saviour and having to work with others to accomplish a goal. As he typically has only tiny budgets at his disposal, Whedon also relies heavily on clever writing, witty banter and comedic irreverence to generate excitement. With "The Avengers", however, he has been granted zillions of dollars and has been unconsciously domesticated by the demands of the summer blockbuster. The result is a film which is continually pulling in two directions, wanting to be huge, bloated and filled with generic spectacle on one hand, and wanting to be clever, small and intimate on the other. In the end, the vulgarity of money wins out over good prose.Still, a number of classic Whedon moments do survive. One cleverly written vignette has Black Widow tied to a chair, seemingly being interrogated by a gang of villains. We then learn that it is she who is in control of the situation and that it is SHE who is interrogating THEM. Another clever moment sees Loki imprisoned in a glass cage at the heart of our heroes' stronghold (yes, that cliché again), no one realising that Loki has designed his own capture, the God of Mischief attempting to live up to his namesake and sow discord within his enemy's own home. Most of the film's other good scenes revolve around the Hulk, who's imbued with much pathos by Mark Ruffalo, an actor renowned for his many melancholic-man roles; Ruffalo elevates everything he touches.The rest of "The Avengers" unfortunately degenerates into CGI fisticuffs, Michael Bay styled mayhem, exploding cities, CGI aliens, errant missiles and sequences which feel like an angry kid bashing action figures together. Here's a film which spends zillions of dollars bludgeoning us, when a guy like Whedon can cook up infinitely more excitement with a simple rope, chair or the sheer possibility that the Hulk might go schizoid. Like most Marvel projects, "The Avengers" mistakes excess for excitement.Whedon's never been a good visualist. Even his stint writing for the "X-Men" comics ("The Astonishing X-Men", a series arc which plays almost exactly like Whedon's "The Avengers" movie) relied more on words, banter, and the energy of his prose than well drawn panels. In this regard, most of "The Avengers" is slow and generically shot, though it does contain a few great visuals. A brief shot of a SWAT squad advancing on the Hulk's tiny shack is particularly cool. Beyond this, the film offers the usual super-hero subtext. Here the enemy hopes to invade America (New York) and obtain the Tesseract, a much coveted cube which can provide endless energy and which was placed on Earth thousands of years ago by Gods. Our heroes, of course, band together to stop the theft of the Tesseract. In a previous Marvel film, "Captain America", a Nazi figure called Red Skull also attempted to acquire this energy source. In Marvel lore, it's always our squeaky clean, white Western ubermensch who decide who gets to keep Earth's resources. Same as the real world, though the Pentagon rarely wears spandex when it's nuking for oil grids.Incidentally, Whedon's Loki is one of the most pathetic super-villains of all time. He's a whiny dude, with all the menace of a high school chemistry teacher. You'd think The Avengers would assemble only for big fish, but no. They apparently take on wimpy Norse Gods as well.7.5/10 – See Josh Trank's "Chronicle"."

8,6-May-12,harry_tk_yung,5,10,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"The long-awaited party (not Bilbo's one-hundred eleventh birthday)","Like Bilbo's one-hundred-eleventh birthday party, "The Avengers" is a "long-awaited" event, after four (not counting Hulk) major features on the ensemble of heroes which grossed a mind-boggling aggregate box office in excess of 2 billion dollars (well over half of which coming from the two editions of Iron Man). The main plot is rather simple, and familiar: (a) Earth is fighting for its very survival against alien invasions and (b) there is an object/device of immense power sought by one and all, good guys as well as bad guys. Assembling the ensemble of six is quite a challenge. Before we examine how cleverly this is done, let's try to catalogue the protagonists. How about into 3 groups? Least "human" are Thor and Hulk. Early in the movie, just before his first appearance, a cryptic remark is made about Thor to the effect of something like he is "basically a god". Hulk remains human, but only until "the other guy" (a term used repeatedly by our hero himself) takes over. Next come the "Six Million Dollar Man" category: human with so much done to their body that they become sort of superhuman: Iron Man and Captain America. Finally, there are Black Widow and Hawkeye (altered ego of "Green Arrow" of the other camp, the JLA?), Nick Fury's special agents who are one hundred percent human but trained to so excel in combat that they are almost superhuman. The villains are quite unimpressive, serving as punch bags for our heroes, who provide vastly better entertainment by fighting among themselves. Let's see how cleverly this achieved by a plot that is nowhere near being convoluted and yet delightfully un-formulaic.While everything evolves around Nick Fury whose brainchild "The Avengers" is, assembling of the team is mesmerizing, providing plenty of opportunities for fights among the heroes. Almost from the first minute, Hawkeye defects to villain Loki who wields a brain-control device. Black Widow succeeds in persuading Hulk to join, but only as a research scientist, not a superhero (they consider "the other guy" more a monster than a hero). Captain America, technically over 100 years old, is revived from his deep freeze while Iron Man is led into Fury's scheme much earlier on (off screen), almost like his partner. Soon after Iron Man, with Captain America's assistance, subdues Loki (part of the villain's cunning plot) Thor who seems to have materialized out of nowhere claims his brother for a prisoner, setting off an exciting bout with Iron Man, eventually stopped by Captain America's mediation. At Fury's headquarter (an invisible flying aircraft carries – this you will have to see for yourself), five of the six Avengers assemble, with Loki in captivity. The villain's plot is to have the defected sixth (Hawkeye) come to his rescue and destroy his captors. He tries, very close to succeeding, to manipulate the team member's different personalities to set them against each other. Even more damaging, Loki thinks, is a provocation to bring out "the other guy", unleashing Hulk's destructive power. It seems to work initially. The attack led by defected Hawkeye provokes the appearance of green monster Hulk. The ensuing combat between the physically two most powerful (Hulk and Thor) is something to behold. While this one is sheer brutal force, the fight between the two special agents is a show of beautiful yet lethal combat techniques. The result: Hawkeye breaks out of the brain control to which he has been subjected and comes back to his senses. As well, Captain American and Iron Man, whose personality conflict has been the biggest obstacle to their cooperation, finally work together as a team.So in the last hour of the movie, while Loki brings out his alien army down on to Manhattan, The Avengers are finally cemented as a team, as you see in the most publicized trailer shot with the camera circling them in an undaunted spirit of solidarity, ready to face whatever enemy that dares to come to Earth. This movie must be seen at least twice. The first time you are dividing your attention between following the story and watching the action. Only in the second time can you fully enjoy the excellent dialogue (rare for an action movie) which will be several times more meaningful than this first. At the same time, you are able to sit back and fully enjoy the action. Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth reprise their respective characters, adding a delightful new dimension on personality conflicts. All this is done mostly through crispy, witty dialogue. Scarlett Johansson and Jeremy Renner, who has made brief and briefer appearances respectively in Iron Man and Thor franchises, bring more complete realization to their respective character, as well as a half-told story of their past relationship which strongly suggests a spin-off prequel. Last but certainly not least is Mark Ruffalo whose soft-spoken, low-key interpretation of Hulk gets two thumbs up from me.And of course there are all the others. Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury, Clark Gregg's Agent Phil Coulson and Tom Hiddleston's Loki need no introduction, and not even reminders. From Iron Man comes Gwyneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts and from Thor comes Stellan Skarsgard's Erik Selvig, two more familiar faces. For a welcomed new face is Cobie Smulder's Agent Maria Hill."

Barton and Banner were mind-controlled by Loki, but that was just temporary. Loki just started a war that he would never win. The storytelling is highly unbalanced. The visual effects and action sequences of the last fourty minutes were sensational and thrilling, yet the long part before it was boring and useless. Some action scenes lack credibility and look fake, as nobody gets injured or bleeds, and the editing of the film is not convincing. The name "Avengers" is misleading, since these superheroes are not avenging and are just saving the world. Particularly, the war criminal Loki was not sentenced to death. "Savers" might be a better name for the team.Overall, this film does not live up to its hype."

Sign in to vote.,"Good fun but still rather disappointing","The highest grossing entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and one of the highest grossing films of all time, this is good fun but rather disappointing. I was hoping that the film would be as relentlessly enjoyable as "X-Men: Days of Future Past", my favourite superhero film of recent years and my second favourite overall after "Superman". However, it never really reaches that the level that he could or should have. That said, it has quite a good script by Zak Penn and Joss Whedon and it is well directed by Whedon.As an ensemble film, it does not offer the same opportunity for the actors to shine as they did in their solo films but that is understandable, if again a little disappointing. Mark Ruffalo, replacing Edward Norton, makes a very impressive debut as Bruce Banner, a somewhat more neurotic character than in "The Incredible Hulk" in spite of the fact that he has far more control over the Hulk than he did in that film. There was certainly a sense of inner conflict in the character but I think that this has more to do with Ruffalo's performance than the writing. Robert Downey, Jr. and Chris Hemsworth are as strong as Tony Stark and Thor respectively as they were in their own films but Chris Evans appears ever so slightly wooden as Steve Rogers in comparison. Downey certainly gets the best material of the four of them, which is unsurprising since he has the strongest and most interesting character. Scarlett Johansson and Jeremy Renner are perfectly fine as Natasha Romanoff and Clint Barton but their characters are far from interesting and, honestly, made no real impression on me. Characters who can kick ass still need personalities.Tom Hiddleston gives the best performance in the film as Loki, who on this occasion is merely the servant of a far greater power. Hiddleston is clearly having a whale of a time with the role and he gets many of the best lines in the film. Samuel L. Jackson finally gets more than a few scenes as Nick Fury and is as badass as you would expect. I did like the fact that they made him a somewhat morally ambiguous character. They tried to give Agent Coulson a personality in the film but he is likewise not a terribly interesting character, though Clark Gregg tries his best. I would have liked to have seen more of Stellan Skarsgård as Erik Selvig since he was one of the best things about "Thor" but he was excellent in spite of his limited screen time. The film also features nice appearances in smaller roles from Alexis Denisof, Powers Booth, Jenny Agutter and Harry Dean Stanton.The film is not structured terribly well and I felt that it spent a bit too much time on the petty bickering between the characters in the first half. It was a tad overlong. In terms of the action sequences, the attack on the Hellcarrier and all the associated scenes are certainly the most exciting. I thought that the Chitauri's arrival on Earth was left too late in the film's running time and, even when they arrived, it was not as exciting as I would have liked. Part of the problem that I had with them is that they are basically a faceless enemy. I would have preferred to have seen more of the Other or get a proper introduction to Thanos. I also wasn't too convinced by the ending. The special effects are certainly spectacular throughout the film. I loved the fact that the Hulk actually resembled Mark Ruffalo in the face! Overall, this is a fun superhero team-up film but I preferred all of the characters' previous individual films."

I re-watched the first 10 or so minutes after I had seen the whole movie, doing so helps put the whole story in perspective. The USA, NASA, and the World Council are all interested in the small cube of energy captured at one time, it allows a portal to a different part of the universe. When it gets a mind of its own in the lab, the mythical god Loki appears with a giant burst of energy, and right away we see he is up to no good. If he can position the energy cube outside, pointed to the sky, his legions will be able to enter and take over the Earth. The main star, in a movie filled with stars, is Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark and Iron Man. We also have Chris Evans as Steve Rogers and Captain America, Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner and The Hulk, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Loki's brother, Scarlett Johansson (my favorite) as Natasha Romanoff and Black Widow, and Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton and Hawkeye. Tom Hiddleston is good and sinister as Loki.We eventually find out, after Tony Stark figures it out, that Loki's approach is to alienate each human superhero against the others, divide and conquer. Humans are eventually saved when the six superheros band together and each uses his and her special powers to defeat the aliens.Of course there is lots of action, much of it taking place on a very large aircraft carrier that can transform itself into a giant flying carrier. Then the final action is in Manhattan, with quite a bit of destruction. In the end it is Stark as Iron Man that diverts a missile with a nuclear warhead, steering it through the upper opening of the portal, destroying the mothership which was responsible for keeping the battle going.Other key characters were Clark Gregg as Agent Phil Coulson, pretty Cobie Smulders dressed in a sleek black outfit as Agent Maria Hill, Stellan Skarsgård as the scientist Selvig, Samuel L. Jackson as facility head Nick Fury, and Gwyneth Paltrow back as Stark's girl Friday, Pepper Potts .Overall a fine action comic book movie."

Thought the way the set them all up was executed very well. Didn't really have a back story going into the movie about the Black Widow character, but her opening scene sufficed. Thought the 'Hawkeye" guy was a cool character but didn't really see how he was a super hero in a sense, if that makes any sense. Hulk, Captain America, Thor are definitely genetically super heroes, and Iron Man is by ways of modern technology, but come to think of it, Black Widow is just a real devastating woman who stands on her own and Hawkeye is also kind of just a guy that's a real good shot, but end of the day, they'd all be great back up if non-friendly aliens came down for a visit. Not wanting to give away the story, just like to add that the length of the movie didn't bother me at all, the character development and was loads of fun. Really enjoyed getting to know characters again."

Well this movie has a little bit of both it's very funny and a main character did indeed die, now I won't give away who dies but will say that it won't be a surprise when you see it. The movie had great action scenes their was a great fight between iron man and Thor, and captain America and an absolutely awesome fight scene with Thor facing off with the hulk they tore up shield fighting each other I mean you will go crazy when you see it. Loki was also very evil his intentions are to take over the world and you want him to lose so bad and he does in the end but you will definitely see and admire the evil in him and you will not be disappointed at all particularly with the scene where the black widow is talking to Loki while he is in the cell inside shield the evilness in his voice will scare you to your core he also does a good job controlling his alien army who are the ultimate adversaries for the avengers and the ultimate threat to the entire planet. But anyway the movie was great the heroes each played their part iron man/ Tony stark was a great leader and made the ultimate sacrifice at the end of the film captain America also had great leadership qualities and has adjusted to the new world he is in quite well and Thor helps with his lightning power and strength without which the avengers never would have survived he knew who the aliens were and that he had to stop his brother Loki at all costs the hulk was great too and did a lot of hulk smashing and smashed a few of the alien ships which was very helpful indeed. All and all the cast was perfect and Joss Whedon crafted an amazing film that will be enjoyed by geeks everywhere for years to come."

This film is decent to watch with the family, a great one to watch with friends, and a superb one to watch by your self. It's high points include things such as: Explosions, innocent civilians dying with not even a last breath, hero's, villain's, okay dialogue, a big green man that isn't from space, thrills, aliens, Gweneth Paltrow, big flying whale things that qualify as, "Aliens", a happy ending, PLOT TWIST, girls with tight outfits, (Wait make that girl with tight outfit) some sandwich that nobody has had before, FRICKEN IRON MAN, no Charlie Sheen, and the destruction of New York!(YEAH!) BAD PARTS: The director is seldom in my opinion he did some okay things, Buffy The Vampire Slayer and he has done some great things, Dr. Horrible's Sing Along Blog. But, for me a superhero movie is a little bit out of his league. This is the biggest thing, Monkey flipping Scarlet Johansson as Black Widow! I mean really Marvel/Disney/Who ever the heck picks people to star in block busters if you guys are just going to put in people that have you know what.(Wink, wink, nudge, nudge you know what I mean. You guys were practically drooling when you first saw her)If your going to put some one like Scarlet Johansson as a superhero then you should just put Rihhana in a movie about robotic Battle Ships, oh wait they all ready did! All I'm saying is that Kristin Wiig or Marion Cotillard would be a better Black Widow then Scarlet is. Any ways all in all this movie is great just put this on a ten disc blu ray set that is over priced and everyone will be happy. SIDE NOT: Cobie Smulders..."

8,23-May-12,jack_face,1,5,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"A mix of the Ultimates 2 comic and Transformers: Dark of the Moon.","I saw it in 2D. It's a combination of The Ultimates 2 comic book and the second half of Transformers: Dark of the Moon. The concept is almost right out of the comic (the comic is far superior) and just like the Transformers movie, the second half is all action with otherworldly technological beings destroying the city in a battle against heroes trying to protect people and ward off the baddies at the same time.Remember that scene where Sam Witwicky was running through all the destruction and he was jumping over cars and stuff like you've never seen him do before and wouldn't expect him to do in the first place? There was a damn near identical scene with Captain America doing the same damn things but you expect him to be able to do what they were showing. Remember how Shockwave and his Driller were plowing through buildings and causing total destruction? The Asgardian ships from Loki's army did the same thing. Remember how Starscream got damaged by Sam and they made him look like a total wuss during his death scene? Loki got his ass handed to him and totally embarrassed by the Hulk. Remember how they opened a portal to Cybertron and things didn't quite work out? Same damn thing happened here with Asgard.The big secret of the movie that was on my mind the whole time was who was Loki getting help from. After the first credits, that was revealed and it's a pretty big deal for long-time Marvel comic readers. It's equivalent to the last scene in the last episode of the Wolverine & The X-Men cartoon. Unlike that, where we'll never get a second season to continue that story, Avenger's 2 has the potential to be an even bigger, better movie if they do it right. The whole Asgard/Earth thing has played itself out in the animated Marvelverse movies and cartoons to the point of them needing to do something new and move on. I never saw Iron Man 2 and don't ever plan on seeing it but it does help to have seen the Marvel movies to have a better understanding of what's going on in this one because there are references and flashbacks. The scene after the full credits is short and only meant to be humorous.Unlike someone I know who said to not pay for this movie, I'd say it's definitely worth paying for. It's a popcorn flick and high on entertainment. There were only a few cuss words so kiddies might enjoy it if they have the attention span (and most don't) to handle the pacing of the movie in the second half. There aren't any over-extravagant Mark Millar stunts and it's not too technical. It's a fairly simple movie that's easy to follow as one can expect from a Marvel comic book movie. If there are any comparisons of this to The Dark Knight because of its box office take, squash that out of your mind. There's absolutely no comparison of any kind to the DC movie other than the fact that they're both based on comic book material.I give the movie 8 out of 10 stars and I rate it that high for its entertainment value. You get your money's worth from this flick and it's deserving of all of its success. One thing I noticed that most people probably haven't is the title. When it opens and even during the rolling credits, it's called "Marvel's The Avengers." They've clearly got Tyler Perry syndrome; as if anyone is gonna mistake this for the British TV show or its film adaptation. I guess they gotta cover their bases."

They made people care about Thor, Iron Man, and Captain America. They built up this massive interconnected universe which is all leading to one massive movie. The entire future of this franchise laid in the hands of this movie. Did it payoff? Obviously it did, but why? Why did Joss Whedon's blockbuster become the 3rd highest grossing movie of all time?Marvel and Whedon had a lot to prove with this movie. They had to prove this massive gamble they took with a connected universe was worth it. And they did.The cast played a big part in this. Seeing Iron Man meet the Hulk and Thor fight Captain America was awesome. Their personalities all played off each other excellently, with RDJ leading the charisma meter. Hulk was recast for this movie with Mark Ruffalo, a worthy replacement for Norton. He makes the character his own. This is the first movie I really started liking Black Widow. Johansson gives a great performance and her writing is great. Jermey Renner does good for what he's given, which isn't little, but he shines in the next movie. Tom Hiddleston does great as Loki, with his few comedic moments being highlights. Samuel L. Jackson is great as Fury, and Clark Gregg really shines as Coulson. The cast is great, not a single person is miscast.The writing is good, with quips galore. It sets up the epic battle at the end excellently, and the character interactions make the movie. A few characters feel wasted though. Evans and Hemsworth both do amazing, but they feel underused. Hawkeye is famously shoved to the side, and that's a real shame. The opening twenty minutes are pretty boring, but the movie picks up after that. But I think it's still very well written.The effects are all great. They finally got the Hulk right. He looks like Banner, just ripped and green. Cap's suit sucks though. Iron Man's suit looks life like. The alien army looks good, everything looks great.I love this movie. I'll never forget watching this movie for the first time and being utterly astounded. Marvel had crafted a masterpiece in my opinion, and I thought this was it. If only I knew how truly epic this series would get.9/10"

I was excited to see it and yet I ended up missing it in theaters and sadly had to wait for it to come out on DVD. When I finally was able to rent it and put it in, I knew right from the start what everyone was talking about. This movie has everything that anyone could ever want out of an hero action packed, semi comical and slightly sad movie and yet, to me, there still seemed to be some mysteries that were left to question. Like any other films that are made to lead up to another it is usually important that one sees the films beforehand so that way they know each characters original story. I felt that with "The Avengers", for the people that did see all of the movies: "Thor" with Chris Hemsworth, "Iron Man" with Robert Downey Jr., "Captain America" with Chris Evans and even "The Hulk", whose character has been played by three different celebrities, that "The Avengers" movie did not follow suit with what had happened in the prior movies. For instance, in the movie "Thor" we last saw him trapped at his home land of Asgard, unable to come see Jane (his love) who is back on Earth. Yet in the movie "The Avengers" he seems to be able to use his lightning bolt powers to magically come down with no explanation and join the rest of the crew in the future. Also when he did come down, he was not with the Avengers yet, he should have taken time to see her. Another thing I did not quit understand (this may be the fact that I do not read comics) is how the Hulk cannot control his anger when he is a raging green monster and he at first fights with anyone that is in a four foot radius but as the final battle scene rolls around he suddenly knows who is the enemy and who is not which also relates back to the fact that when we first meet him in "The Avengers" he has himself hidden away someplace peaceful so he does not get angry and lash out. I just think that those might be some minor flaws in the story line.However, all around, I think that "The Avengers" is a good movie. It has everything that a person could want out of a Marvel movie, which has been dishing out amazing stories for a long time. The choice of actors/actresses for each character and each movie makes up for the little "umm,so wait, how did that happen?" with their personalities and the way they make it seem as though they have been those characters all their life. With all the flair the movie has, despite the leaks in the story line, I would give this movie an eight out ten."

8,13-Nov-12,leocicida,1,4,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"I love It","The movie Avengers is a must see film for all viewers. The all-star movie fulfilled the high expectations of the world most powerful superheroes saving the human racing. Within two minutes, the movie quickly picks up after the self-sustaining energy force, that is stolen by a semi god named Loki. As gripping as the story line starts off, the special effects are just as spectacular. The headquarters ship to aircraft sequence was breathtaking enough. The effects were so realistic that it begged the question if such technology is real. Thor's sex appeal is enough to keep the ladies watching with his hammer of steel, lengthy hair and rugged style. Thor's fight with Captain America was certainly unexpected. If anything we expected an all-out war with the many quips that Tony Stark a.k.a Iron Man flings around. He brings comic relief to the otherwise tense cast. Dr. Bruce Banner a.k.a Hulk is remaining calm as ever and typically does nothing for a good part of the movie besides fondle some technology and look busy. Every once in a while, Dr.Bruce Banner comes out of his office along with Tony Stark to explain the magnitude of the energy force and the some strategic advice. Later on, he character becomes truly essential to defeating the bigger aliens. Captain America is almost as useless in the beginning because he's not up to date with any of the technology so he just sits around trying to grasp the concept most of the conversations between Mr. Fury, director of S.H.I.E.L.D, and the rest of the avengers. At one point he blurts out "I get that! I understand that phrase. I do, I get that one." Referring to a pun made by, none other than, Mr. Stark. We do however find out that Captain America is arguably the wisest of the team. Somehow he's able to slide in some subtle wisdom like "we've got to put that (problems) behind us and get this job done" and "Sometimes there isn't a way out." Iron Man earns the most improved award in this movie. He goes from a rich self-absorbed hero to a still rich, now deserving the title, hero. Sad to see but other characters didn't really change much during the film, or grow in morals. Sometimes, it's nice to see such super heroes grow into better people. Along with the almost stationary characters, the background didn't really changer either. Most of the action and plot took place of the aircraft. The movie can be dwindled down to two main back drops, the aircraft and the downtown of New York City. Combat in this movie is of epic proportions. You have the entire kick ass fighting styles of a super hero and Special Forces but without any of the excessive blood splatter that can sometimes just demean an entire movie. Crowds should flock to this movie for its stellar use of special effects, heroism, and best of all to see our daring young heroes compete in war."

8,16-Nov-12,unit370,0,2,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"How the new movie relates to the comic","Avengers: Marvel At It's BestThe Avengers movie that came out this past summer was one of the best movies that has come out in the past few years. It was the much awaited superhero movie that would combine the movies of: Iron Man, Hulk, Captain American, and Thor. Although the Avengers was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time it was not perfect. The problem with most, if not all superhero movies is that there are so many different stories or universes; it is hard to pick which one to make the movie about. The Avengers movie proves this point by having different characters other than the ones that were in the original Avengers comic, which this movie is suppose to be about. The first team members of the Avengers consisted of the Hulk, Iron Man, Thor and one that was not in the movie, Ant Man. The first Avengers comic was issued on September 10, 1963. Captain America does not even join the Avengers until the comic "Avengers #4" issued in March of 1964. The plot of the Avengers movie was great; it does a good job of blending the new age of comics with the old. The movie kept the same plot as the first comic book, with Loki being the main villain. The one difference is the time period of which the battle takes place. In the comic it takes place in the 1960's, which makes sense since that was the time period it was written in, while the movie took place in modern time. Joss Whedon did a great job in converting the old out dated form of the Avengers into the new time period. He did this by adding modern military weapons like the F-35, as well as adapting the whole story to modern times by adding in space travel, GPS, and better computers, just to name a few. The actors that played in the Avengers movie by Joss Whedon each played their character very well. The one actor that really played his part well was Robert Downey Jr. He played the part of Tony Stark extremely well. His character is self centered, has an extremely large ego, and to top it off, he looks almost exactly like the comic book character. Another character that I thought did great job in this movie was Mark Ruffalo, who played the Hulk as well as Bruce Banner. The Hulk has been in two other movies other than the Avengers, and both movies have had different actor's portray the Hulk and Bruce Banner. The one in the Avengers was by far the best one they have had. The way Ruffalo played Banner was extremely close to way he is portrayed in the comic books. Banner is a confident scientist who is not only looking for a cure, but is also using his knowledge to help society. Unlike the other movies that portrayed Banner as being a scared, and work obsessed scientist who is only focused on curing himself. In conclusion The Avengers movie was an amazing culmination of all of the Marvel movies they have made up to this point. The way the director interlocked the stories and different movies gave everyone who watched them background information on the various heroes as well as the villains. Although the time period that the movie took place was different than the comics, the director did a great job in carrying over the key aspects of the comic. I would by far recommend this movie to anyone who loves action movies, superheroes movies, as well as comics."

Sign in to vote.,"The adaptation comic in movies","The success of The Avengers film is a result of the brilliant Marvel's history and its ideas. The Marvel Universe has grown a lot since its beginning in the 1950s. What started as a series of comic books would become one of the most popular entertainment franchises in the world. Marvel has since expanded to explore mediums such as comic books (of course), short films, feature films, video games, and a television series all based on characters from the Marvel Universe. This process made the Marvel to a big fantastic factory of dreams.The Avengers is an example of film that the people know as transmedia, because the sequence of the film happens in different media, platforms like a game online,a specific novel or graphic novel in comics form, comic, cartoon and film. The process of adaptation is very important as well, especially in this movie, because this process becomes possible to work comic features specific in a film and vice versa. The film's idea was born from the adaptations of the comic book "The Ultimate Avengers". This comic book gets a new form, a book form that is the graphic novel. This new forn brings a new meaning to the same text.The Avengers plot talks about the power cosmic cube. This power is the cause a war and in the same time it is to threat a planet's safety threat. The cosmic cube is a specific object in Marvel's stories. The concept was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby and first appeared in "Tales of Suspense", in July 1966. The power cosmic cube is important too, because it transformed its holder's any wish into reality. Here, it becomesan inexhaustible source of power named Tesseract, which is under the power of S.H.I.E.L.D (Strategic Hazard Intervention Espionage Logistics Directorate)., organization led by Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) that seeks to protect the Earth with the aid of the object. The plan backfires, when Loki (Tom Hiddleston), Thor's brother (Chris Hemsworth), who was trapped in an alternative dimension, returns there with the aid of alien Chitauri and gets the cube to revenge the Terrans and the God of thunder. From there, the feature engages in short stories full of action, which serve to show the bonds that are formed between each hero before the formation of the avengers. There are the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Captain America (Chris Evans), Iron Man (Robert Downey JR.), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Agent Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders) and the other agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg).Finally, the problem with this film is your specific plot, because for the Marvel comic reader that OK. But the occasional reader and lay person may some difficulty understanding the Marvel Universe. For example, the cosmic cube is a specific ficcional Marvel comics object and this object is very important for many comic stories creations."

All Hail The New King!","I have got to tell anyone who will listen that this is one of THE best adventure movies I've ever seen. It's almost impossible to convey how pumped I am now that I've seen it. I purposefully avoid hyping myself for movies because when expectations are too high, nothing seems to be able to reach them. I usually avoid the hype train whenever possible. That said, I was jacked to see this movie and was fully aboard the hype train. It couldn't be helped. So, I was certainly open to intense disappointment had this movie not been good. I'm so happy to report just the opposite has happened.The only word I can think of to describe this movie is AWESOME. It's amazing work and everything I had hoped for and more. It's exceptional entertainment for the uninitiated but it has everything a fanboy could want to be sure. It has every little nuance of what a fanboy wants to see. One of the MANY things I loved was the tension and flat out conflict that arises between team members. It's not a two dimensional "team wonderful that bands together to fight crime ho ho ho." Most don't like each other at fist and there is so much texture to be played. That is great because so many of these characters are larger than life. They have egos and the big guns aren't used to working with other people or even playing by the rules. Stark, Thor and Banner all work "the other side of the fence" so to speak. Then there's the Widow, Hawkeye and Captain America who are used to following orders and playing within a command structure. They are all thrown together in a wonderful and, best of all, believable fashion. Again, more than I ever dreamed possible.The entire cast really delivered. You needed more than just action actors or stunt doubles to play all these parts. The pathos is there but so are the timing and true deep performances. Look, I was missing Ed Norton as much as anyone on that hype train I talked about but I'm so happy to say that Mark Ruffalo won me over. I hope he's locked up for the long haul because we don't need any more changes. Three was the lucky number for movie Banners. Every other actor in Avnegers that we've seen before is BETTER than their previous incarnation (EVERY single one) with the possible exception of RDJ as Stark. He's great but it's hard to top his take on the character from the original Iron Man in an ensemble movie. I also have to fully disclose that I'm insanely attracted to Scarlett Johansson. I thought her Widow character was amazing but I'm definitely judging that through rose colored glasses. The character arcs that run there course during this film will surprise a lot of general audiences expecting nothing more than a Transformers type popcorn scarfdown.I honestly don't want to give away ANY of the movie with this review because this is one film that needs every scene to be savored. Do yourself a favor and remain unspoiled. It's how I saw the movie (apart from what the trailers showed) and even though you're obviously reading this review, read no others with any kind of spoilers whatsoever. Experience the awesomeness for yourself. Avengers as a movie and as a team on screen is an unstoppable force. I'm just going to say, Hulk & Thor combination equals AWESOME and leave it at that. This movie defines MUST SEE."

Joss Whedon has created one of the most action-packed Marvel films to have graced the screen, full of humour, thrills and a great cast of characters, all of which impel this visual effects-driven spectacle. Whilst I had the great opportunity to watch this epic in the cinema in 3D, the film is equally as stunning on an average television set, with the final battle between the Avengers and Loki's army being one of the most spectacular scenes in a superhero movie.

As Good As It Gets!!!","If you're a fan of epic adventure movies, then this is your dream come true. This is the type of film you fantasized about growing up! It really is the ultimate superhero mash-up and it's done perfectly. The makers of this film certainly understand spectacle but they also get the intricacies and depth these type of characters can provide. That right there assures this instant classic will be thought of as the best as well as the biggest film of 2012. The depth of this movie really did surprise me. Even though the high quality of the actors involved and there previous work as these very same characters seemed to indicate otherwise, I was expecting a wild popcorn movie. I was wrong in thinking it was too much to convey in one film. I couldn't be more pleased because they balanced everything masterfully. Sure, there's the popcorn fun we were all expecting but there's also a definite soul to the film and a smart plot as well. It's truly a stupendous movie regardless of genre.Marvel did it, they pulled off the culmination of a master plan that's been taking shape for years. They deliver a movie the likes of which we've never seen before and as good of a film that's ever been made in its genre.There's a reason this grand of a movie has never been attempted before now. How do you fully flesh out, care about and establish this vast group and still deliver a fun, crisp and coherent story? It's extremely difficult to navigate that edge-of-your-seat excitement while at the same time caring about each one of the characters and their struggles. One of the most impressive aspects of The Avengers is that they managed to get each hero their time in the spotlight and their own character arc. Every single main lead steps up and is treated with remarkable intelligence and given room to shine.I loved that the stakes in this film are ridiculously high and the threat so impressive that there really is a need for these diverse characters to come together. That could have been a stumbling block in terms of story but it's treated just right. It's also a great idea that they chose to introduce all the characters to the audience as if you've never seen them before. Sure, the other films set up and give depth to each character but even if you missed their solo films, you'll still know and care about them in this movie.It's also wonderful that everything is as big as it should be. This truly is the comic book epic of our lifetime (the fanboy version of Gone With The Wind circa 1939 if you will) and it all shows up on screen. Everything looks GREAT and feels epic. The equipment (love that Helicarrier), the relationships, the stars, the characters themselves and the battles are all huge and as fully mesmerizing as they should be. There are scenes that are emotional and there are scenes that are going to make any audience member scream "BADASS!" and mean it.I'm serious when I say that the big, explosive moments are as grand as they should be but it's the smaller character moments in this film that really take it to another level. At this point, we've all seen how good some CG action can get but grounding it with a great story and with meaningful quieter moments is what makes a movie good. That's the ace up the Avengers sleeve. This is NOT some CGI video game movie. Cut out the action and I'd still want to see this movie. So, it's safe to say that they are replicating the comic book experience on the big screen. Years of depth coupled with spectacle and advanced fiction is a treat for non-comic book and comic book fans alike. That's is The Avengers greatest power... the ability to entertain all comers!"

The idea of putting all the superheroes in one film is a good idea, because viewers get great value for the price of a ticket. The stellar cast and the constant action is quite amazing. The visual effects are great, especially the finale which lasts for an hour! The massive destruction of Manhattan is literally earth shattering, I was quite in awe of the aliens flying through the skyline, and all the action that goes on. I enjoyed the film a lot."

I thought it was smart and the impressive cast really delivered! This movie works on so many levels and makes you draw on just about all of your emotions. I don't remember when I enjoyed a movie this much! Such cool fantasy but what makes it extra special is following this film after all the other solo efforts from each character. I enjoyed the others films quite a bit but they all delivered something different. Seeing them blend together in Avengers and the sparks that resulted was the extra special treat. Example: They blended the grounded futurist (Tony Stark) with the Norse thunder god and his angry brother in a perfect way. Same could be said for every other character. It all works. In fact, it doesn't just fit, it's a symphony and that dyconomy and difference in characters are what makes it truly great. It's why this movie stands so tall above any other franchise at the moment. Things like Transformers, GI Joe and even Star Trek all operate with monotone restrictions. Avengers covers all angles and delivers depth with its fun.I haven't enjoyed a movie this much in years if not ever!"

I've been waiting for this movie since Sam Jackson's character uttered those famous words after the first Iron Man film... Stark now knows he's not the only superhero in his world and it's as big a treat for our real world as it gets. Seeing the "Avenger Initiative" in action is as great as I would ever have hoped! Hell, who am I kidding, I've been waiting to see this movie all my life. Who would've thought years ago that ALL these characters could fit in to a film and all of them be done justice? It delivers greatness from scene one and has to be considered the best this genre has EVER produced. Truthfully, as good as some of the previous work has been from every studio, nothing else has come close. That's not hyperbole; I really think most will agree if they see it with an open mind. I loved this movie's depth, heart, humor, gravitas, action, performances, emotion and payoff. I honestly can't wait to see it again with the rest of the world later. Right now, I'm simply basking in the greatness I just witnessed!"

(Best Villain in Years!)","I'm happy to report that everything established in previous movies pays dividends in a big way. It's not that anyone needs to see those other Avenger solo films before seeing this gem but it certainly adds depth and texture to this amazing product. Not having to intro big main characters deeply allows the action to flow but also allows for better development. This also allows them to probe deeper into the character's personalities. This heightens the tension, so often missing from comic-book movies, and adds real weight to the story as well as the action sequences which are thrilling and often mesmerizing. The result is a film that's just flat out exceptional.Of course all the phenomenal heroes got to shine and the story accommodated them all perfectly. What I loved is that Marvel did it again with their main villain. Loki was just so wonderful and complex in this amazing movie. Spurned Loki masterfully dances on the fault lines of villainy and redemption. He always keep people guessing and. Again, that's just shear perfection coming from the god of mischief. He has such a mixture of emotional psychological complexity. You have somebody who's capable of thinking and strategizing at the speed of light, but underneath that is a deep well of pain that at any moment threatens to boil over and Tom Hiddleston plays it like the master he has become. This is Oscar worthy villain performance good.The performances in this movie are as good as any I've ever seen in an adventure film. The great actors say that acting akin to playing tennis. The rally that they play with a new partner is completely different from one to the other. Each of these GREAT actors have such specific talents that it's fun to see them play off each other at different times in this movie. I think Whedon realized this as both director and writer and shuffled things around on purpose to play to strengths. It's just another wonderful aspect of this spectacular movie event."

Sign in to vote.,"A Gem of an Action Movie","The Avengers (2012) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Nick Fury brings together Iron Man, the Incredible Hulk, Captain America, Hawkeye and Black Widow to join forces and do battle against an enemy that threatens global security in this rather amazing comic book adaptation. I'll be honest and admit that comic book movies aren't my #1 type of film and it wasn't until just a month before THE AVENGERS opened that I bothered to check out the casts supporting movies. I enjoyed the two IRON MAN movies, thought THOR was very good, THE INCREDIBLE HULK was entertaining and I found CAPTAIN America to be decent but no matter what I felt about those films it couldn't prepare me for how much I enjoyed this one. Director Joss Whedon has created something incredibly special and you really can't help but think he's raised the super hero bar so high that many future films are going to have problems reaching it. When bringing all of these characters together, the filmmakers could have taken an easy route and just give us mindless action but that wasn't the case here as Whedon really delivered a deep but easy to follow story and he knew how to have fun with it. The constant banter between the superheroes could have led to some very unfunny moments but the screenplay was so smart in allowing each of their personalities to come through and then added the fun of taking those personalities and throw them at one another. This banter really turned into something incredibly funny and allowed for some great one-liners as well as some terrific action. When it comes to these type of movies I usually complain about a couple things. One is the obvious CGI but that wasn't a problem here because it just looked so realistic that it never took you out of the story and instead it put you more directly into it. Another thing I usually complain about in recent mainstream movies are the expanded running times. THE AVENGERS clocks in at 142-minutes, which made me nervous going in but it turns out that this film proves long running times are okay as long as you have enough to support it and this movie does. In fact, the long running time felt extremely short as the film flies by without any problems. Say what you will about comic adaptations but there's no question that THE AVENGERS is first rate entertainment thanks in large part to the great direction, the detailed writing and each of the performers fitting their roles and bringing them to life. This here is without question a complete success so future comic movie makers had better step their game up."

8,10-Jun-12,tedg,11,22,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"Other Worlds","From time to time, I have the gift of unique movie audiences. I've watched "The Brady Bunch" in an after school audience of teen and preteen LA girls. Down the road from where I live is the Pat Robertson school of film where most students believe they are in a fight with the devil and film is a most powerful tool for Jesus, and I can feel that in the response to certain films. My home theater is in the midst of a significant military area, so I sit next to warriors and their families when wondering about the war movies I see. This includes the so-called seal team six, and all the navy pilots in the mideast.But the most precious of shared dark space is when I am in Shanghai. I saw this film there, the only nonasian in the crowd — other than the 7 year old I was with. Then after a period of reflection, rewatched 'The Empire Strikes Back.'So I saw this film about the clash and merger of different worlds and dimensions while in full swim with that dynamic myself. (Chinese officials block access to IMDb, so this comment will be posted on my leaving.)The Star Wars films, the first of them anyway, demand only two extensions of the universe beyond a projection into the future. We assume that the future (or we did then) would include large machines, space travel and expanded notions of universal governance. There is no particular need to modify what we accept as the world we live in on that account. The notion of the force, and how it is woven into Jungian family dynamics was the big leap, the thing that forces us to stretch our universe. I think I understand the appeal of this across ages and cultures.The Marvel universe requires a different set of expansions. The time is now, yet we have world government and massive military machines and the same anachronistic limit on weapons. (There has been no advance in weapon technology: guns and swords.) We no longer need monsters to be designed to that actors can suit up, but even the CGI characters inherit this limit. But because they have to engage in hand-to-hand combat, we'll be asked only to assume beings more or less like us (but ugly) and big machines. They have the same notions of weapons (swords, guns, blasters) we have in both the real world and the cinematic sci-fi world.These limits ask little of us, but they limit the battles to be that same old crap we have seen hundreds of times before. The only thing Marvel could have brought was competence. Whelon does that.Where Marvel asks us to extend our universe is in the acceptance of complete, independent other worlds. These are not just different planets with the same physics, but different dimensions with (as much as the comic artists can imagine) different physics. This is a big assumption, and I suppose only a few enterprises (religious ones) can pull it off, because you have to take the space to define the different laws of the other dimensions.Marvel had a crew of different artists and writers, and they did not start out with a combined universe in mind, until a few managers until they combined several weak characters to sell more comics. (Stan Lee takes the credit for this, and I do not know the history well enough to dispute it.)So we have Tony Stark who really asks that we believe that the reach of technology will expand. We have several Marvel characters that also require only that we accept normal scientific accidents: radiation-based usually. The main disruptive device here is a crystal that asks only that we believe it emits some unknown radiation. This is only a cousin to the mysteries of the LHC. That takes care of Fury, Iron Man, Hulk and Captain America. Hawk and Widow are just spies with extraordinary training (along the lines of Batman).Thor, Loki, Asgard and the creatures from yet a third dimension are what expands this. We are asked to believe in an open, manyworld universe. Not other planets (as with Superman). Not humanmastered magic (Harry Potter, the Jedi, Dr Strange), but other worlds. I credit Lewis Carroll with making this possible.Having said that, what Whelon does is allow the character interplay to be a reflection (that is, folded) commentary on these assumptions. Everyone among the 8 or so members of the team looks at and questions the worlds of the other. This is where the Chinese context comes in. I suppose in the US, Captain America is seen as partly a joke, what we shorthand as only a "cartoon," but here that distinction is lost -- especially as the actor is encouraged to take his role seriously. Here, what we have is Team America taken seriously.What is seen here — and the China market for Hollywood blockbusters is as large as the US market — is a dull-witted, good-hearted American soldier taking command. He is manipulated by the government and military leaders, and supplied with the most extraordinary technology. He even — and no one should be surprised by this — has access to the powers of the other worlds. The blond hair and Germanic manner really stand out here.Oh and the redheaded girl, with the spotty past, guile and commitment to do good.I have no idea what effect this will have on global audiences. The Marvel franchise is now as powerful as that of Star Wars and Potter, and much more able to be mapped to current events. Fury even references them. But I can tell you that this was a thrilling experience, to see this with the additional fold of the audience, some of whom looked away from me when leaving the theater.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

Sign in to vote.,"Great Movie and Easily the New King of the Genre","Everything has converged perfectly, delivering what is now the new king of the genre. The Avengers is certainly the best overall comic adaptation film ever made. Really, how could it not be? They positioned this thing with FIVE other set up films that were each remarkable in their own right. Not only does it all come together but I'm happy to say this amazing cast delivers in every way. Believe it or not, every single character featured previously in those five films gets time to really shine at one point or another in this astounding movie. Even though the set up has been epic, the result was anything but assured. It would have been easy to be overwhelmed by the task of putting all these great character together and making it click but they pulled it off perfectly. Maybe it's because the characters themselves are complex and intriguing and that they have been brought to three dimensional life by people that really care. Whatever the case, EVERYONE hits a home run here. They fleshed out perfect cohesion while remembering to include the fun and humor that have made those other five films good. If you define those films as good then you'll define Avengers as great. It's a unified step up and I didn't think that possible. What's also amazing is that I think this movie works without having seen any of those other films. Then, the fun factor will be enjoyed by those that didn't care about the other movies. The depth and amazement will come from those that have invested in to this universe. What they've done is transcend any other of this genre's films by going deeper and doing so in spectacular fashion with Oscar caliber performances. Again, easily the new king of the genre."

Most Superhero comic book movies seem to share a problem in tone. Most films try to cope with wild concepts by emphasizing darkness, even over-emphasizing it. Troubled, brooding characters, black leather and anger rule the day. Here, the Avengers mix everything so well. It leans to the dark but touches on fun and the interaction of every character just enough. Maybe it's the fact that all the lead characters got their chance to be introduced in their own movies or maybe it's because they wanted genuinely real dialogue but the movie feels real and believable. It's truly better than any other comic-book based movie that I have ever seen. I say that not to egg on fans of other properties because I AM a fan of other properties. Because of the groundwork that has come before and because of the high level that this film operates, it IS bigger than any have ever delivered. ALL the dramatic beats really click. Besides the depth and action pieces, so much of the humor works because it is so well written. The writing displays true character establishment and development over the course of the film but never gets bogged down by the shear number of characters. What's also rare for any summer movie is that just about every scene packs real emotional weight. This is what you get when you mix fine acting talent with outstanding material. They make it shine and give you a remarkable movie that people will be talking about for years to come. The TV clips seen leading up to the movie tease at the action but there is SO much they saved for the actual running. I can't thank them enough for that factor. They knew they had a hit on their hands so why spoil the word of mouth! If you liked the trailers and TV stuff, YOU HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING YET! That in and of itself was a pleasant surprise. Avengers is a complete and very well done movie and as much fun as I've ever had in the cinema. That's no lie or no joke."

I'm not a huge fan of any of these superheroes, and haven't been up to date on most of these. I only saw the first Iron Man and the two Hulk films, but honestly nothing Marvel released since then. The Avengers surprised me. It turned out to be a fairly slow-paced film with subtle character dynamics and nuanced performances. Okay, really, it's just a BLAST! Nothing more has to be said. It has a tone that giddily encourages you to get on board. It's pretty much everything you expect, but it doesn't insult your intelligence. In fact, the characters and dialogue are all pretty well-written. A film like this could have had just as amazing action sequences, but with lesser writing and development, wouldn't be nearly as satisfying. Truly, there's something to enjoy in all of these characters, particularly Banner (perfectly portrayed by Ruffalo) and the always charming Tony Stark (Downey Jr.). Having not seen Thor, I enjoyed him a lot too and thought Hemsworth was pretty excellent. Technially, it's excellent. The editing is fantastic, and there is not a single flaw within the editing achievement. Editing action films, especially in their big moments, can be very hard to accomplish, but these filmmakers did an impeccable job. The action sequences are amazing, and big, huge. Overall, there's so much excitement to be had here. I don't have a problem calling The Avengers THE "perfect summer blockbuster". It truly is, and boy what a ride it is. Strongly recommended to everyone."

Forget comparing it to other films of the genre. I'll save that for a later date because it really isn't important. Judging it as a stand alone piece of entertainment, it's the best time I've had in theaters in a very long time. First off, forget what you think you know or expect because it operates at a higher level then anyone would have guessed. There is very little clichéd about the film. They establish their own universe by themselves but it is so aided by all the previous solo lead in films. If you've seen them all, you're in for a real treat with Avengers. If you haven't, you'll enjoy them MORE now watching them after Avengers. They fearlessly take the adventure wire to wire but manage to make you really care about every circumstance, character and scene. Every character is believable given the nature of the universe they establish. You really are drawn in to the world and to the each and every character right from the first act. That connection makes the action more meaningful, just like with the best of movies regardless of genre. The dialog has been called superb by fans and critics alike for a reason. The conflict and tension present between EVERYONE (protagonist, antagonist, friend, and foe) absolutely makes the film. The performances that stem off of that are all remarkable. The charisma this film packs, and there's plenty of it, comes from the flawless performances and the dialog. Also, the supporting cast is utilized perfectly. This is as good and as fun of a film that has ever been made. Bold statement, I know. I rarely rely on critics but when nine out of ten of them praise this film they are doing so for a reason. It makes you wonder what those few others saw or how much they were paid not to like an instant classic."

8,6-Sep-12,bob the moo,3,7,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"Consistently enjoyable effects and noise with the right amount of fun mixed in","You could be forgiven for approaching this film with trepidation for many reasons. The most obvious is that it is a big superhero summer blockbuster film – a type of film that is popular but all too often disappointing (indeed an accusation that could be levelled at films featuring characters in this film). Secondly though, a common problem with all the various character films leading up to this joint effort is that they generally struggled to make all the characters fit and you had the constant feeling that all the positioning and introductions were hurting the individual tales just for the sake of this joint one; so I did wonder how it was going to cope with all these characters running around in one place.Ironically enough though, the character balancing turns out to not be a massive problem in this case and I think it is partly because they do all exist as equals within the same plot lines, rather than being forced onto others. The plot is suitably overblown and involves an intergalactic threat rather than a man-made one; again this concerned me at first because I didn't particularly care for Thor and I did get the feeling that this would be more of the same, with gods and mythical creatures running around. To a point this was the case here because to the casual viewer (which I am), these aliens aren't really known or understood but the film does make it work because it allows it to be just about serious enough to avoid spoof but at the same time generating sufficient fun so that you go along with it. In some ways it is the polar opposite of the other big superhero franchise out this summer (Batman) because where one aims for darkness and introspection, Avengers really has no interest and instead focuses on delivering fun and action in an easily accessible and enjoyable package.And this it does. Across all the characters we have good humour and banter which never undermines the action but rather adds to it, giving it a sense of fun that engages and helpfully prevents you questioning the detail too much or having things like specific comic banter stand out against the serious nature of the action. There are lots of nice comic touches and lines but for me Hulk randomly punching Thor was the high point (with the "puny god" moment being a very close second). The cast go with it and I liked that everyone did work together without any one specific character hogging too much of the screen. Downey Jr is fun as normal and he works well with Evans, who I thought was better here than he was in his own film. Likewise Hemsworth benefits from a bit of decent humour and fun (two things lacking in his own film) and Ruffalo makes for a good Hulk, again though he is helped by the lack of having to carry a whole film. Johansson and Renner are good in support and the rest of the cast features good turns from many familiar faces, none of whom get in the way but all contribute to the fun.It is easy to turn your nose up at Avengers because it is basically an effects-driven summer blockbuster about superheroes, nothing something that always delivers, but to do so would be to ignore the fact that there are good and bad examples of this and that The Avengers is one of the good ones. Colourful, busy, fun and generally very entertaining – it delivers everything it sets out to do and I found it very enjoyable for this."

Just like "Transformers: Dark of the Moon", this film was eagerly anticipated by fans, such as myself. I could not wait for the film to be released on 26th April. Unlike "TF3" however, this film live up to the hype. It surpassed my expectations (and I expected a lot). It didn't feel forced and certainly did not feel like a sequel to one particular lead-up film. It felt like a well-made sequel to ALL the films.The final battle wasn't just an all-out brawl - it seemed integral to the story and characterisation of the film. Every character had their "time to shine" and they were as you remember them from their "build-up" films - Tony Stark was cocky, witty and likable, Steve Rodgers was patriotic, a "man-out-of-time" and focused on the mission and Thor was a demi-god warrior. Then there's the Hulk, played by Mark Ruffalo instead of Ed Norton this time around. This Hulk/Banner was perfect. Ruffalo brought a sense of humour to this famously angry character and really helped pull-off the Hulk where others have either tried and failed (Hulk 2003) or tried and only just failed (The Incredible Hulk 2008). We also got a brief look at Black Widow (Scarlett Johanson)'s background and her relationship with Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). Even next to their super-powered team-mates, these two proved their worth to be part of the team.Tom Hiddleston as Loki was brilliant, Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury was what you'd expect from this actor, Clark Gregg was once again great as Phil Coulson and Cobie Smulders as Maria Hill was a good decision and while her performance was good I feel she was underused. This film has and amazing soundtrack, brilliant actors, likable characters (even Loki), great 3D effects, an enjoyable story and epic action. Congratulations and thank you to Director Joss Whedon and the rest of the crew for putting together a masterpiece."

With so many great characters w/ great stories, you'd think the writers could have put together a good story. But no--that's not what obscenely budgeted films with the sole purpose of setting up a franchise care most about. Everyone's already pointed out all the ridiculous plot problems, so I'll just say that the writers had NO excuse when there's an entire comic series worth of stories to supply all they needed to work things out. A waste of some decent actors and lots and lots of money. (Pretty clear that the only moment Samuel Jackson actually enjoyed was when he got to walk out and blow up one of the jets. He looked bored or in pain for every other mediocre line.) I enjoyed most of the witty one-liners...and that's about it. Shallow on so many levels...who cares how shiny the CG was or how many things got blown up? The studio may have raked in disgusting amounts of cash based on the hype (and the promise of a great story), but will anything else about this film be memorable? Can't see how Stan Lee would have been pleased..."

I'm not a comic book aficionado in the least, so I went into the movie without any of that background knowledge. Nor did I need it, as I soon found out. There's enough back story inserted to get folks through & the back story of the characters isn't really integral to the story, I thought.The plot was VERY predictable. There was nothing new or original about it. Can easily see where the story is heading and pretty easy to guess how it will end. So, in that regard, I'd give the movie a 1 out of 10.Where this film shines -- and is downright amazing -- are the majority of the graphics. Fantastically intricate CGI work! From that aspect, I'd give the movie a 9 out of 10.So, basically, this is a great one if you're looking for mindless entertainment as the story line isn't a challenge to follow. Definitely a feast for the eyes!"

What other movies will be measured to in the years that follow.","Marvel's Avengers is everything a movie should be, and more. It goes without saying that it's the best film of the year to date. There's a serious subtext to the story and great characterization throughout but its focus is on the amazing. As an adventure film, it really has no parallel. When a movie reinvents a popular genre, it speaks volumes. This movie does just that and accomplishes what they've promised us since the first Iron Man movie... giving us that "bigger universe" in all its glory. The movie gets just about everything right but maybe its number one strength is the casting coupled with the writing. Meaning that every character has the perfect dialogue and every quality actor inhabits the hero they portray perfectly. Downey has Stark down cold but we knew that already. He's just given the right stage to shine here. Evans finds his pathos and his chops in this film as Steve Rogers. The Boy Scout all-American has an edge this time around. Hemsworth's Thor has understandable rationale for joining and doing what he does throughout the movie. His inner turmoil and guilt is exquisite. Tom Hiddleston certainly has the acting chops to hang with any movie villain EVER and he's perfect because this is no one dimensional character and his motivation and progression since the Thor film is seen and felt. Samuel L Jackson actually has something to do in this movie... PRAISE BE! Jeremy Renner is a nice addition and even with all the big guns chewing up every scene, he shines. Movie goers will want to see more of his character in the future guaranteed. Scarlett Johansson adds to the casting perfection. She's every bit the complex yet sexy female lead and a match for any male on screen. Would you expect any less from a Joss Whedon film? The interaction, conflict/turmoil and the relationships all work well and is definitely one of the highlights of the entire movie itself.Add some of the best kick-butt action sequences that I've ever seen and Avengers is what other movies will be measured to in the years that follow."

Let me explain what I loved! Positives: 1. The characters; this is a no brainer! Without these awesome characters this film would be nothing. They honestly shape this film and their banter and chemistry with one another is awesome! There are a lot of humorous as well as heartfelt moments which all lend to an awesome film! 2. The villain; Loki in my opinion is the best villain of the MCU. He has motivation you understand and his rivalry with Thor is mesmerizing! Tom Hiddleston once again does a fantastic job as this character and he was the perfect villain for this movie. 3. The action; all of the action is done well! There is quite a lot of CGI, but it doesn't get in the way of the film, and because of these awesome characters all the action and explosions have weight to them. If these characters hadn't been characterized properly, and it didn't have a well made story then this film would've probably turned out like a Transformers movie. Thankfully that was not the case and all the action was awesome! Overall: I have no cons with this film that I can think of. The Avengers is one of the best comic book films I've ever seen! It is by far one of the best things Marvel has ever done and it was one of the most fun I've had watching a movie! Even if you aren't a comic book fan I guarantee you will enjoy this film! Don't go into this movie expecting a mindless action movie like Transformers, this film is a lot more deep than that."

Sign in to vote.,"one hell of a movie!!!!!!","I AM HULK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The Powerhouse, the boiling bed, the grizzly, machismo and the Ultimate hammer-head, he knows how to pump up your very source of adrenaline.I regret that I watched this movie late- but it was due to my exams that I wasn't able to do so. But if you still haven't seen it yet, I tell you bluntly, you are a fool!'Avengers' is the best super-action movie I have ever seen!!!It's not due to the story, not due to the theme, not due to the super- star cast. The real hero of this movie was the awesome special effects and of course, that includes Hulk.The arena is all set. We have Ironman, Hawkeye, Thor, Hulk, CaptainAmericaand Black Widow to set the stage on fire. And what are they facing? Gargantuan, bulk bio-mechanical aliens with a centralized connection system, they lay down the New York City to dust, smoke and metallic rubble.There wasn't a single moment that you actually feel bored or out of place. This movie kept me glued to the screen throughout.Now, for the characters..Hawkeye: He is a good guy, turned bad guy, then once again into a good guy. Don't let his metamorphosis confuse you. Because his explosive arrow (for those who understand 'brahmasthra'!) indeed made me reminiscent of the good old fight between Hindu Gods and Demons. He is good, but still, just a little bit less than the others.Black Widow: Don't even dare take her at her face value. She is never what she appears to be. She is docile and meek when she wants to leech out information from you, but ruthless and super daring when she stomps down the aliens to their gory end. Best scene- The way she takes control of the alien ship. She may soon stump down Emma Watson as my favourite heroine.Thor: He is a force to reckon with, literally. The power to wield thunderbolts never ever ceases to amaze me. And it didn't in this movie. There was an awesome fight sequence between Ironman and Thor. Best Scene: The way he makes the entire skyscraper an electric conductor and focuses the electricity on the warp hole, blowing the bulky, snaky aliens to smithereens.Captain America: Though low on actual power, he can still wield his shield and send Thor flying away distances. He is the Captain Cool, one who likes to plan out things and do accordingly. A tad old-fashioned (of course he is old-fashioned- he is old, the scientists literally thawed him back to life!!) but he more than makes up with his patriotism and his iron-will to see it through the end.Ironman: A billionaire, genius and a philanthropist. Ironman is indeed the superhero with panache. He can be the style icon for all the superheroes- the way he undoes his suit is awesome, uber cool gadgetry, superb dialogues and a sexy iron suit that can do cool different tricks. Oh Man! He was simply superb. Of course he takes away the cake, when he directs the nuclear missile through the warp hole and into the heart of the alien stronghold.Hulk: No comparison. He, according to me, was the life and soul of this movie. Well, I must complain- that these Hollywood blockbusters always show India in poor light, even though that part does not represent India as a whole. Maybe they have the 'Great Indian Poverty Fetish' or the 'Dharavi Syndrome'. Well, but this feeling of being disparaged does not last long as we soon see the Doctor 'awakening the green bulky giant within' and being transformed into Hulk. There are actually three 'City Moment of Success' related to him. 1) The way he pounds the great snaky alien to dust. 2) The way he punches Thor. 3) Now this was the best scene of the move- he thrashes up Loci in the very Chota Bheem style- that was awesome. I can still remember the reaction that Loci gave..Maybe it doesn't have much of a story. But alien invasion movies are not meant to have one. What they are meant to have is spectacular fireworks, and this had those aplenty.Every time, I see a movie like this- my heart pumps faster, my whole body gets filled with tout electrical energy. It is as if, I were a character inside the movie. I loved the feeling, I loved the movie.Miss it at your own peril"

8,21-Sep-12,frezeframe,4,10,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"Highest no story rating ever!","Ever seen one of those muscle pageants where they flex and flex and flex and flex... and then they come back on and flex some more? Well, that's kind of what the Avengers is like. Nearly every scene is a huge climax and it's just a wet dream of adolescent violence and fantasy- with no one being held accountable for any character actions. I knew there wouldn't be much for story going into the big summer Marvel franchise comic book blockbuster, but I did expect an attempt at story. Look at Spiderman or to a lesser extent, Transformers. Sure, they sucked, but at least they tried. A blockbuster movie should be like a play to some extent, showing subtext and depth, rather than just defaulting on raw special effects exhibition. Why? Because these Billion dollar franchises can afford to hire the best writers in the world. But they don't. They feel that their numbers, data and formula will make them more money than the tried and true Aristotle/Socrates methods of portraying the human condition in a three act structure. And they're right. Money trumps all, for the film industry is at the end of the day, an industry that bases everything on huge profit margins (one the largest margins in the history of mankind, in fact).However, if you look at some of the masterpiece visual effects movies of the last few decades (which Avengers tried so hard to be), there is a common thread that puts them above the rest: They all engage in creative storytelling where characters are held accountable for their actions in some way, no matter what the level of fantasy is. That extra effort pays off in the subconscious and is the sole reason why a movie with effects alone can't give us the cerebral satisfaction of a Star Wars, Jurassic Park, Lord of the Rings, Avatar, Aliens, or Terminator 2. These type of films are like a Broadway show, giving you big climaxes and well timed beats. You could say The Matrix would be more like a Cirque du Soleil. The Avengers is like the body building pageant(as the Avengers themselves are constantly trying to out flex each other throughout the whole movie).I have a rule, regarding my 1-10 movie rating system: Any movie without a story can only score a maximum of 5 (flawless effects-great acting-no story, respectfully) This is not to say that all the writing was bad in The Avengers. The dialogue was actually quite clever- perfectly timed comic relief. It's strange that Hollywood is notoriously bad at delivering honest, unscathed human emotion and experience, but so good at delivering comic relief (one of the hardest things to do in all entertainment). Here's The Avengers story synopsis: All the leads are invincible- action, action, action- One of them has turned bad and tries to take over the world-action, action, action- he fails, but lives at the end to set up the sequel, action action, Roll credits. It literally plays like it was written by a 10 year old boy who plays with action figures in his back yard. (then spiced up by a team of ghost writers with well placed jokes and lots of Downey Jr. nuances) Wouldn't surprise me if that' what actually happened.Is Avengers worth watching? Yes. The acting is great (except for Scarlett Johnasson- who is brilliant in her own right, but NOT a believable superhero). It's funny and very intense. Big action, big sound, testosterone, gunfire, some bow&arrow action, missiles, gadgets, rocket powered things, aliens, a nuclear bomb, martial arts sequences, gunfire, even a touch of romance. A man's movie, through and through.But I'm not so sure. I think any good "man" movie should actually have in depth storytelling (The Matrix, Aliens, Aeon Flux) Why not go the extra mile, guys? Comic book movies should be held to the task especially, because it was good storytelling that made their franchise pop in the first place. Film is a different medium. You can't just expect everyone to know all the backstory- and make things bad ass for the sake of seeing something bad ass. You have to work at it a lot harder to tell an effective story in an arena where you are being timed to 2 hours of attention span. Avengers fails, just like most comic book movies. Sin City is a great example of effectively crossing over from comic book (graphic novel) into the film medium.It would be nice if Hollywood spent just 1% of the 200,000,000.00 spent on a movie like this, toward paying a team of talented screen writers. Imagine if David Mamet had written this... or Aaron Sorkin? With all the money and power and technology and talented artists bursting at the seams (like the Hulk) to exhibit their skills... it just seems like a no brainer to show us what money can really buy.So, it's a no brainer movie. Just really good eye candy and a few laughs."

Sign in to vote.,"Marvel's The Avengers is truly marvelous","Marvel's The Avengers directed by Joss Whdeon is one of the best movies belonging to superhero genre ever.The Iron Man,Thor,The Black Widow,The Captain America,The Hulk,The Hawkeye.Phew!Watching the superheroes on the big screen,with the three-dimensional(3D) effect sounds great but the viewing is exceptionally awesome.Although the movie has had its release in Bahrain quite late(4th May) whereas in most parts of the world the movie was scheduled to release on April 11th.This is one of those rare movies which may have been sounding great on paper but is exceptionally awesome even when viewed on the celluloid.Story:- Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) is director of S.H.I.E.L.D, an international peace keeping agency. The agency is a who's who of Marvel Super Heroes, with Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), The Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). When global security is threatened by Loki and his cohorts, Nick Fury and his team will need all their powers to save the world from disaster.The only draw-back of the movie is its length.Lasting up to 143 minutes,one would have got exhausted but thanks to Joss Whedon who provides enough of entertainment in those 143 minutes! The direction by Joss Whedon is marvelous.He does a great job! The action scenes has been shot very well and the use of 3D effects makes the action sequences look more stylish.Performances:- Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man is excellent.Mark Ruffalo though has a shorter screen space still manages to register an impact.Chris Hemsworth is good.Chris Evans is excellent.Scarlett Johansson is fine.Jeremy Renner is subtle.Samuel Jackson does a good job.All in all,The Avengers is a must-watch for all the super-hero fans.I am going to give it a nine on ten.Two Thumbs Up!"

Exceptional In Every Way!","As 10/10 as it gets!What makes Marvel great is that each of their Avenger solo studio films are packed with emotion and draws the audience in with relatable characters. The viewer cares about them and gets invested in to their story and character development. Now, magnify that times ten! Add way better action then we've seen from them in the past and you get the greatest genre work ever put to film with the Avengers. This movie more than lives up to the hype! I was on the edge of my seat several times during the film and I can't believe how fast over two hours flew by. Avengers is THE best comic adaptation film of all-time, period and end of story. That doesn't take away from past exceptionalism, even past Marvel films themselves but Avengers just delivers beyond what we've seen before from anyone. As good as Spider-Man 2 or TDK were, you really can't compare them because they operate on a smaller canvas and deliver far less notes. After seeing Avengers, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about if you're being honest with yourself and fair to the movie itself."

The jokes were hilarious as well, the audience kept on laughing. This film is a solid 10/10. If you are skeptical about seeing the film, you shouldn't be. Every minute of it was mind-blowing.

Sign in to vote.,"Worth the wait","For we super-hero fans, this movie has been long time coming but the end result largely justifies the wait. We've had two Iron Man outings and separate films highlighting Captain America, Thor and the Hulk. Now these four - plus the lesser- known Hawkeye and Black Widow are assembled by S.H.I.E.L.D to combat Thor's evil brother Loki whom we have seen before. Balancing so many larger than life characters and featuring so many special skills must have presented a mega challenge but director Joss Whedon - who gave us another ensemble piece in the under-rated "Serenity" - has done a skillful job and as co-writer he has crafted a sharp script with plenty of wry humour.No viewer will doubt that British actor Tom Hiddleston makes a wonderful super villain, but opinions might differ on who makes the best super hero. All six candidates - Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Jeremy Renner and Scarlett Johansson - give fine performances and bounce well off one another in the early, competitive phases but, for me, Downey Jr is still the ace in the pack.There is plenty of action and excitement and the special effects are well done, although it might make a change for a city other than New York to be smashed up and, in the 3D version I saw, the extra dimension only really worked in the final titanic battle."

Nick FuryWith all the blasts and bullets of The Avengers, there's enough humanity and humor to win over even this jaded film critic. Although I'm tired of American cinema's pervasive graphics and violence, six heroes saving the world from an alien invasion in this outstanding sci-fi are as satisfactorily flawed in character as they are superior in strength.Director Joss Whedon masterfully balances the egos, not least of which is Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury, the S.H.E.I.L.D. leader whose long leather coat is second only to his awkward eye patch. Loki (Tom Hiddleston) returns from Asgard to fight his half brother, Viking god Thor (Chris Hemsworth) of the lightening and hammer, and five other super heroes for control of earth. Everyone is smart in a way and weak in another. For example, if genius scientist Dr. Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) gets angry enough, he becomes a giant green monster, Hulk (and a swell job Ruffalo does at that); Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.) with the very metal suit is dangerously loose with his toys and his women. But his banter is first-rate.Martial-arts maven, Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), joins as well as Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), whose archery skill is matched only by Katniss in The Hunger Games. Black Widow and Hawkeye probably were added to the group for sex appeal and comic-book accuracy, They all end up fighting for the freedom Loki denigrates in the beginning of the film. The battle of the box office they already won with almost $200 million in European receipts before opening in the states. Who said crime doesn't pay?"There is no throne, there is no version of this where you come out on top! Maybe your army will come, maybe it's too much for us, but it's all on you! Because if we can't protect the Earth, you can be damn sure we'll avenge it." Tony Stark to Loki"

If there was ever a case for expectations being unreasonable then this was it. Also, we always get some anal fans that are too attached to their comic book preconceived notions. Either Avengers stayed very close to its root origins or people are judging it as the fine film it turned out to be. It's both to be honest and it seems most enjoyed it as much as I did. Anyone worried that Joss Whedon would make something this epic look like TV work needs worry no more. Visually it is a sight to behold and as epic as it deserves to be. I don't remember when I enjoyed a film THIS much and I really loved a lot of 2011's offerings. This movie just hits the highest level possible for me. It works on all of its own terms, there's no weighted enjoyment or cinematic slumming involved in enjoying it. It really IS a smart action film and the cast really delivered as expected. With this exceptional cast involved, how could it not? Whedon knew who his aces were and how to play them. Downey and Jackson are CLASSIC. That's not to say every major character didn't shine at one point it's just that when the beats mattered, the big guns when front and center. I also LOVED what Whedon did with Loki and how much of a home run Tom Hiddleston hit. Avengers truly a remarkable movie treat and I'm glad to see that the majority of film fans agree with me. The movie works on so many levels and makes you draw on just about all of your emotions. Best of all, you leave the theater smiling and completely wanting more."

However more emphasis seemed to be on these 2 characters and the other characters sort of fell behind. The movie had the potential with so many superhero characters. It could have done much more and could have been even better. Having said all this, it is a one-time watch at least.Not enough to deserve an 8.5 though.Good but not that great."

Without giving away the plot, at no point does the viewer actually feel the superheroes are in danger.I have an irrational hatred of Captain America so I am rounding down from the 6.5 score that I feel it deserves. (His quote about Hitler directly contradicts his role in the film, he's a filthy hypocrite that gives the AMERICUH!! vibe.) It's a fun watch, but this is evidence of the dumbing down of cinema for a worldwide audience.Overseas markets are big money, but because cultures are so diverse, to appeal to the world the movie is forced into a least common denominator.

The highly anticipated Marvel Comics ensemble arrives on the big screen in style in this entertaining collaboration. Wastes no time setting things in motion as the iniquitous Loki (Hiddleston) descends to Earth to obtain the Tesseract and subjugate the human race. Out of options, S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury (Jackson) recalls the Avenger initiative, uniting a corps of Earth's most remarkable heroes including self-obsessed Iron Man (Downey), humble Captain America (Evans), mighty Thor (Hemsworth), agile Black Widow (Johansson), adept Hawkeye (Renner), and volatile Hulk (Ruffalo), to make a definitive stand. Fun, flashy, and fast-paced, this epic-scale adventure delivers just what you'd want and expect with an unforgettable cast of characters, breathtaking action scenes, striking visual effects, a disarming sense of humor, and—most importantly—a good dose of heroism and humanity.

While its not essential to see the other films it's does help to fill in some gaps. The music score isn't particularly memberable but heightens the on screen action accordingly. Where as spider-man reeked of quick cuts and a cgi replacement, Whedon and team manages to keep Avengers comic book action integrated, accessible and visually coherent.  Notably Mark Ruffalo replaces Edward Norton as Hulk/Banner and sits quite nicely with top cast that includes Robert Downey, Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Stellan Skarsgård and Samuel L. Jackson. A few sub- character also return. The story isn't overly complicated and sticks to a bumper issue Marvel edition. The film doesn't try to overly deepen the characters and stays close to the comic book spirit and roots. Packed with one liners, top effects and great comic book characters The Avengers ticks all the boxes that arguably some of the stand alone prelude films didn't manage to do."

There was so much hype surrounding this movie, it became almost impossible not to see some kind of advertised praise of how epic it would be. Then came the IMDb movie reviews... Within the weeks leading up to the release, as well as multiple weeks beyond the premiere, you would be hard pressed to find any review that wasn't at or near a perfect 10/10. It quickly became apparent that these were paid reviewers, as all the reviews seemed to have subtle words, structure, and nuances in common, along with an extremely strange hyper-in-depth biographical portfolio of personal knowledge for the historical work of every writer, producer, director, musician, camera operator and even extras in the movie. All extremely uncommon knowledge to be so readily described in every person's review to support this movie. Last, was the extreme repetition of descriptions such as "spellbinding", "breath- taking", "edge-of-your-seat", etc.However...Once biting the bullet and paying money to finally see it, I almost laughed out loud! How in the world a movie with: horribly stiff acting, nearly no plot beyond "bad guy wants to destroy the world, we must put aside our differences and unite" cliché, oddly outdated CGI, terrible 'Batman & Robin (1997)' style punch-lines and puns, surprisingly really low-budget looking costumes and props, and uneven main character screen-time (aka The Avengers is 85% "The Ironman Show", 10% "The Thor Show", 5% everyone else) ever, ever received any Review Score over 5/10 absolutely blows my mind.Don't let the advertising, infallible Marvel die-hards, or paid reviews fool you; this movie is the 2012 version of all those 90's Superhero Sequel attempted cash-grab franchise movies we grew to hate until their demise (Batman Forever/Batman & Robin, The Phantom, etc). Ironman (1) and especially Batman Begins restored faith in the whole, "Revamp the modern Superhero movie the way it should have been" genre... and now it's spiraling right back to bland, dull, blatant cash grabs; with this movie the king of them all."

It isn't supposed to have any deeper meaning or advanced plot. This is a movie mainly for comic fans. I'm not much of a comic reader, but I still enjoyed it.There was a couple of things I couldn't quite ignore though. I thought the invasion was pretty terrible. The aliens sent in only a couple of worm things that contained a few alien CGI soldiers and bumped into a couple of buildings. It was not exactly an effective way to take earth. The second thing that kind of annoyed me was the aliens. Just to keep it PG-13, there is no gore, and the aliens are nothing but CGI bad guys.I was worried there wouldn't be enough screen time for each of the super heroes, considering there were so many, but I was pleasantly surprised to see that they all had their roles and input. What really annoyed me though, was Cobie Smulders. What an unnecessary character to throw into the movie! She did nothing of importance AT ALL! I don't know if Cobie's character is in the comics, but it's still just annoying to see her on screen. It's just a cheap business trick to have more stars in the movie and of course adding a fine movie to her resume. Every time she was on screen, it just reminded me that the film industry is just a business like everything else.I'd give it 8.0"

Hits A High Standard Of Excellence","Hands down, this is THE best film the genre has ever produced.All too infrequently, a much hyped blockbuster hits the mark right on the spot. Then there's the rare beauty that hits ABOVE the mark. The Avengers is such a movie. It EXCEEDS the already high expectations. It's the best big budget movie that I've EVER seen. It honestly may be my favorite movie of all-time. It hits a high standard of excellence by combining a cool plot, breathtaking action sequences, charisma, crisp and witty dialogue, the perfect villain, actual character development and puts it all together in one amazing package. For those few out there that didn't have high expectations, this movie will surprise you with its heart while sacrificing none of the fun. The inner turmoil within each character as well as the outer friction between such diverse individuals worked exceptionally well. We really can relate to each character and why he or she feels and acts the way that they do. Rest assured that The Avengers does delivers on every level and does so with great emotional moments.It's a movie that lives up to all the hype it has generated and will continue to generate now that people are seeing it and falling in love with it completely."

It had a non- stop feel and some of the best action sequences I've seen. Is it a great action movie? Absolutely! Is it one of the best superhero movies ever? I'm not an expert in the genre, but I bet it is. Was it one of the top 50 overall movies of all time? No way!I was really shocked when I saw an IMDb rating of almost 9 for this movie and I'm hoping that over time, cooler heads will prevail and bring the movie's rating down into the 7's where it likely belongs.I found that the writing was fine for an action movie but I certainly didn't lose myself in the reality of it all. There were a number of sequences where the dialogue and interactions of the characters was not believable or compelling.I apologize to those who would quip that dramatic dialogue and characters with whom the audience can empathize don't belong in this type of film but I think they do and I'm sure we'll see it someday.Go see this movie - well worth the trip to the theater to see it on the big screen. Savor the amazing special effects and action scenes that are so well put together. Please don't suggest that the film ranks with some of the all time great works of art that have made it to film."

Sign in to vote.,"As Amazing As Any Movie Ever Made!","In keeping with Marvel's best efforts, Joss Whedon sets this movie apart from every other standard adventure movie, by the way he communicates the overall experience. We live the story and we feel the intensity and gravity of every situation. We fully embrace the characters as we go along on this amazing ride. It's so wonderful that we got to know each of the major players in their own solo movie(s) before this adventure. That just adds a ton to the depth. This movie isn't about comic book pulp or things that go "boom" but about a powerful, exciting and meaningful story. The elements are fantastical but perfectly balanced by the characters and the way Whedon grounds everything.Visual and emotional imagery are presented throughout the movie and provides the viewer with greater insight into the heroes AND even the villain. Everything here screams quality and screams fun all the way through. Yes, despite the depth and serious consequences there is a great deal of fun. That's something I'm so grateful that Marvel usually delivers. For those going into this flick expecting a lot of fun, prepare to enjoy. But remember, fun is not the only piece of this pie. In fact, I think most movie fans will be stunned at how many levels this movie delivers upon.This is a smart and surprisingly deep film that really delivers on everything promised in all those teaser set-ups from other Marvel films."

There is nothing wrong about this film, the casting is perfect, the script is perfect, the film is just perfection. I went to see the film with my family and my mum isn't a huge fan of superhero film's but after watching this film she wanted to re-watch the other Marvel films as she loved this film so much, which goes to show the brilliant cast, director and writers have gone above and beyond to produce the perfect superhero films that even gets people who don't usual enjoy them into becoming a lover of the films. One of my favourite things about the film is the tension between the heroes at first and the bonds they end up having at the end of the film Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr) develops a great bro-romance with The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo). Hands down the best film I have seen in 2012, and best superhero film EVER, I'd love to see how they top this film as the expectations are running high. This film is lacking nothing, if you haven't seen it then you need to watch this film ASAP."

But here's what they need to realize = you don't walk into a theater to watch "The Avengers", a movie that's SUPPOSED to have multiple superheroes, without realizing it's supposed to anyway.This movie had a lot of action, good humor, and great acting. What are people thinking giving this movie bad reviews just because one thing was hokey = how Loki got out of that place he was stuck in. Maybe if they saw the post-credits scene to Thor, they wouldn't mind as much.Whatever is running through the heads of the people who rant on this one, I can think of something that will turn their argument around. If not turn it around, at least make the argument a tie. Avengers was a great movie. Bottom line."

Sign in to vote.,"Avengers: action adventure at its best","Like everyone else who was anticipating this movie, I had heard the massive hype, and built up my expectations to the point where let down was all but inevitable. And so I went to the midnight first showing, hoping for something good, but half-ready for a bit of disappointment. Things didn't quite go like that. To put it simply, The Avengers is a triumph of a comic book/superhero film. Among fans, it will no doubt rank as one of the best Marvel based movies to date, if not the best. It's a downright great action film, right alongside any blockbuster, and a fairly solid adventure film.Let's start with the characters, acting, direction. The team here is composed of seven heroes, many of which have their own proper films, and each of which is played by a very talented actor. While this might seem to bode well at first glance. It can't be understated how hard it is to balance such strong personalities, both the characters and the actors themselves. How do you make one movie, that basically wants to tell seven stories? And where each of those stories basically demands to be center stage? It's not easy at all, you have to fit a lot of pieces correctly. And Avengers is something which could easily have fallen flat if one of those pieces was off.But Joss Whedon and cast did a commendable job of balancing all the characters' needs together, bringing each one fully to life, while still allowing the team story to take center stage. No one here gets left out, everyone has their time in the sun. And yet collectively it all fits together to make the movie more than just an ensemble of heroes, but the story of an actual team. In particular we see very good, believable dynamics portrayed, with how everyone is assembled, then has to adjust to working in a group setting, and ultimately become more effective within the Avengers then they would be on their own. In particular portrayals by Robert Downey, Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo all shine in molding the team together. Iron Man is used to going solo; The Hulk has never been able to be a team player; and Captain America has a hard time dealing with people who don't really want to follow a group. That said, it really was all bright spots in the cast and characterization. Let alone, there is never once where the individual portrayal of the actual heroes comes into question, they are all spot on.The visuals and effects are of course as good as one would expect. Top notch all around, as good as blockbusters get these days. One thing that I did not expect is how funny this movie was; there were so many good witty bits here and there, I think people were laughing throughout the whole film. Some moments were outright hilarious. Which is another thing about this movie, it was fun. Period. If you can leave the film critic at home for a moment, this movie is escapism at its best. It's a pure ride of action, adventure and fun, wrapped up in delicious effects. The last half of the movie flows so smoothly, it's all over before you even know it.Some will want to compare this to the Dark Knight, and basically they will criticize it because it's not 'dramatic' enough. But not every film is a drama; not even necessarily every good film is a drama. The Avengers is not the Godfather or Dark Knight, and it was never meant to be. But if you can live with that, then it's a fantastic action-adventure movie, right alongside such greats as Indiana Jones, Aliens, and Die Hard. Among fans, it is sure to become a classic. And again, it's just wonderful escapism, which aside from Pixar animated films we don't usually get enough of these days. Everyone wants to be so serious :)) It's a family film too since there's not much objectionable here. Overall, very highly recommended."

I'm not saying this to anger the Nolan nation or egg on the Distinguished Competition but I'd have to rate Marvel's Avengers a true 10/10 masterpiece and THE best comic book movie ever made. It is as close to a perfect movie as you can get regardless of the genre. I've noted before that Superman has generally held the title as most fondly remembered or nostalgic superhero film even though it has some campy flaws. Spider-Man has generally held the title as most beloved superhero film because of the character. TDK has generally held the title as most technically sound and highly rated superhero movie. Iron Man has generally held the title as best all-around superhero film. Thor and Captain America jumped in last year and added their own unique flavor but I can honestly say that Avengers tops them all in every single category. It is IMO shear perfection on every level. It's smart, intense, well acted, thrilling, fun and superbly done.MARVEL'S been on a roll since the record breaking success of Iron Man and here's where it all pays off. And man, does it ever!!!!!!! Avengers has my vote for film of the year because it lives up to all the hype and all the hope. This movie was excellent and entertaining and deserves all the praise it has gotten."

Sign in to vote.,"avengers and their team work","The Avengers Since we can remember, there has always been that one person who we always looked up too. That person we believed was our hero, the one person who would always run to our rescue, whenever we called upon them. It wouldn't matter what the situation was; unfortunately as the years pass our hero's change. We become to know the real definition of a hero and our deception of them changes, a hero, which is a person, typically a man, who is admired for courage or noble qualities. Such as the character or characters in a book, play, or movie who have these noble qualities. Throughout the movie the Avengers, we learn that being a hero is not the easiest thing, it takes a lot of courage, time, hard ships and team work to accomplish the most impossible. As we see, when the heroic team, Iron Man, Hulk, Captain America, and Thor is reunited on the ship for the first time; tensions were high as we expected. They all had a different plan and understanding on how to defend their world and to take down Loki. Their inability to come together and be a team at first is a major factor is their main source of vulnerability and the outcome of Loki being five steps ahead of them. It isn't until one of their own is killed by Loki; that they actually become the Avengers. They put all their differences behind them and finally suit up to stop Loki from taking over their world. The courage each of them has to sacrifice themselves in order to make sure our world is safe is indescribable. The unstoppable force that forms when they all put their special talents and gifts together are unbreakable, their allegiance to one another is their upper hand to taking down Loki. In their finale desperation is stopping Loki and closing the portal, the viewer's get a glance at what a little bit of team work and courage and a passion for something can get you. Their team work got them to close the portal, each Avenger's courage is the reason they saved the world. And finally, their passion and pursuit to stop Loki was their unbreakable bond formed throughout the movie. Overall, the movie The Avengers, was not only made to show the comic story of the heroic team stopping Loki from taking over our world but also to show everyone what team work and courage can get you in life. You don't have to be the smartest or the strongest but if you have a big heart and a strong passion for something, don't let anyone stop you from achieving those goals. Even if it maybe you saving the world from an evil villain."

Is it normal to keep on working in a high building if the city is under siege of a bunch of aliens?When there is a far view of the beam on the city, you see ships still not moving away from it.They are not fleeing the scene. The aliens that attack the earth, have not even powerful weaponry, only small firearms,or ships with a very small blast radius. There are no huge blows.If I was to invade earth I would bring serious firepower.The army of Thanos, has not. I did not see the US air force, anywhere!!You would say that they would scramble all jets to fight the aliens.The army and navy (with cruise missiles to knock of any target that comes out of the beam) are not in sight either.Where are all other superheroes when earth is under siege?It makes no sense to make a event with this impact (the earth is at stake) if you are not able to get all heroes in one movie.I know there are different franchises, so I would suggest that something else would be at stake, the live of a superheroes or a small republic.Now this has become a movie with huge gaps, all heroes survive miraculously and Coulson relives in a series after he died.It is poor."

8,9-Nov-12,johnwaidhofer,2,6,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"2012 Action Movie Blockbuster","Amazing, revolutionary and exuberantly humorous are just 3 statements that describe this action packed but surprisingly complex plotted blockbuster movie. This film brings together the characters from the marvel comic book series "the Avengers" and gives you the action and effects of a big time movie but still gives you a comic book feel. When this movie came out I was swamped with work and did not have enough time for a movie. I worked hard and finally got a small window on a Friday night to see a single film. Luckily for me my friends were planning a fun night that included seeing "the Avengers." When they invited me I felt extremely lucky that this coincidently corresponded with my free time. When we got there I knew it was going to be a fantastic movie. Even though "the Avengers" had been out for weeks the movie theater was packed. Me and my friends got front row seats and experienced the full gripping action this movie had to offer. This is definitely a movie to see with friends because of the humor. As people would expect (if they have seen the previous movies) Tony Stark a.k.a. Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) tells the most jokes. Many of these jokes are based off of rivalries such as the one that develops between Captain America and Tony Stark during the course of the movie. Captain America feels order is needed in the Avengers and that there should be a more established chain of commands. This conflicts directly with Tony Stark's spontaneous and freedom loving attitude. The clash results in humorous jiving comments from both heroes. There was also overall humor between all the character s making the movie wonderfully diverse.Like all super hero movies there was an abundance of action. The difference that made this movie stand out however is the twisting storyline. In the beginning, you discover that Thor's brother, Loki, has received an ancient power from an alien race that is after the Tesseract, a cube of unlimited power that is in the United States possession. The strange otherworldly powers these creatures have and their forms give Marvel studios a chance to put their graphic arts to the test. Also producers had to use imagination and skill to fashion the battle scenes throughout the movie. Marvel made these scenes so that they feel like you are reading a moving comic book. The action scenes throughout the movie never disappoint.While the action and humor of this film are good many people have complained that the beginning drags on a bit. Many super hero movies get right to the action while this one links all the Avengers stories. Before you see this movie I suggest to see the other origin Avenger hero movies. This will make the beginning more interesting. Lastly, the deep plot is like the icing on top of the cake. This movie brings the attitudes of all the characters together and shows how they fit together. The main part of the story is about the characters finding out how they work together. You can even sympathize for the villain, Loki, who is always in his brothers shadow.In the end, this is the best action movie I have ever seen. Even the second, third and fourth time I watched "the Avengers" I found some joke, underlying plot or important turning point that I hadn't seen. This multi-layered plot is the foundation of great movies. On the other hand many action movies have amazing structures or great affects and battles. It is very rare that you find one with both foundation and and a structure together in one move but one without the other is useless. "The Avengers" is a sturdy building that will survive a long time in the neighborhood of movies."

8,18-Nov-12,Brittany-Jurczyk,2,6,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"Avengers Who?","The Avengers was a fantastic movie bringing all the Marvel movies together seamlessly. This is what I may have said if I'd ever seen or read anything Marvel in my life. Now, I realize this isn't the movie or producers fault, I'm just speaking for myself who happens to be utterly ignorant and oblivious to the world of comics in general. To start out the movie, I was happily surprised to think I was following the movie without any background knowledge. Suddenly I came to the realization that I was mistaken, being thrown into some sort of futuristic space ship setting. I was continuously introduced to new characters that didn't have character development as I was expected to be read up on that information before hand. The importance of the characters and their role in the movie tended to be a roller coaster ride. At the beginning, Scarlett Johansson grabbed my attention and stole the movie with everything she had to offer to the action side of the movie. She even took on 3 men without a blink. Somewhere along the line she ends up standing in the shadows without much to offer until the ending scenes. Chris Hemsworth's role in the film seems lost to me as well. The back and forth between helping Loci and wanting to take him down seems almost as if he's lost on which side to take. This was distracting to me. As a whole, the characters were interesting, however didn't exactly connect the story well. By the middle of the movie it dawned on me that it was becoming more and more predictable. From what I've gathered, no super hero movie has ended in the super hero's loss. Loci shows no sign of changing his ways from "evil" thus, the outcome become inevitable no matter what Loci throws the Avengers way. From that point on, every conversation of confusion between the characters and talk of what the next step will be to take seems pointless. The wondering and guessing games could have been done without as far as I'm concerned. The ending of the movie seemed to be too far fetched and far too drawn out to be enjoyable. Plausibly, they all should've died before the Hulk came around. The way the creatures were destroying buildings, it was hard to accept the fact that, even with super powers, they were destroying them one by one. The setting of this battle was also a little out of reach. Showing everyone walk away unharmed and guarded by the NYPD is beyond realistic given what the other creatures were capable of. None of the pedestrians seemed to even be worried about the danger in the aftermath, only thankfulness and gratitude for those who saved them. Is that how it would really happen? I surely wouldn't think so. As for the meaning and the plot line revolving around the Tesseract, I couldn't even being to explain that to someone. The power it holds and the large question "why" it holds the power it holds still confuses me. The knowledge needed for this movie before going into it seems to outweigh watching the film out of pleasure. While I understood the concept of the movie and could still gather main points, I believe that it reached out to more of the large Marvel fans that have been following for years, or decades. This movie was slightly disappointing, but what do I know, I'm still asking the question, Avenger who?"

Joss Whedon has done a remarkable job in adding a huge wave of emotion that runs over the film. Iron man is the machine with a heart, who never shows it. the Hulk is the definition of all heart and no mind to control it. And most surprising of all, Black Widow comes with a beautifully nuanced performance. All hints of fear, love and hatred evident in her subtle reactions. Scarlett Johansson is a casting choice to be applauded, as is Mark Ruffalo since I now cannot imagine anyone doing better justice to the role.Whedon nailed nearly every single scene. He made every superhero movie which is already out look very outdated. This movie is 140 minutes maybe and 130 minutes are money shots. I have to find new superlatives and words are still not enough if I wanted to describe my feelings. And after seeing the trailer and the pictures, I already had high expectations.The charisma of Captain America, the wild brutality of the Hulk, the majesty of Thor, it was all there. I was never the biggest fan of avengers, but right now, after writing these lines, I am going to read up some avenger comic books from my collection and we have 2 am."

8,18-Nov-12,ashley-talion,1,4,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"the avengers","The Avengers was a good movie, but took a little while to get into. At first I was very confused, seeing as I have not watched any of the other Marvel movies. Nothing was really explained as to who the characters were and what their importance was, it was just assumed that you knew. As I was watching the movie I asked many questions to my companions and needed things to be explained to me in order to understand everything that was going on. Without these people to clear things up I may not have understood a good portion of the movie which would have made it boring and uninteresting for me to watch. As the movie began things jumped around a lot, which made the storyline hard to follow. Characters were bouncing around from place to place and new people were being brought into the story without any real introduction or reason. Further into the movie everything came together and was more understandable, but they could have done a better job writing the beginning. Again, without explanations from the people I was with I would not have understood exactly where the character were coming from and why they were being brought it. The only reason a person would not like The Avengers, in my opinion, would be because they had not seen previous Marvel movies in which these characters were featured. Once things were explained to me and I understood the role each character played it was a very good and entertaining movie. The plot kept twisting and just when you thought something was under control it spiraled off into a huge mess. Things such as the villain freezing himself and collecting more and more power or such as the people he turned evil becoming good again just in time to help save the day. It is an action packed movie with something new and unexpected going on at all times. All of the superheroes come together in order to stop an ultra-powerful force from outer space, but their ideas and morals clash in ways that could inhibit them from making clear decisions and in the end saving the world. Besides personality clashes, the hulk is also unable to control his powers and becomes a threat to everyone when he morphs into his large green alter ego and begins to tear the place apart. This nerve wrecking movie keeps you on the edge of your seat and you watch hoping that everyone can get along in time to defeat the villain."

Sign in to vote.,"the avengers","I have never really been into the whole super hero movie type of thing, but in my opinion the Avengers is a great action movie. I like that all the characters had a major role to play Whedon didn't leave nobody out or behind. I liked how splendid the graphics were and how it just makes the movie more liver. My favorite character in the Avengers is the hulk. I like how he tries to remain in control then after a while all of a sudden something just sets him off on a rage. The whole action scene is just to live from the graphics to the hulk ripping thing out of the walls and throwing them. The whole idea of this movie is excellent. I love the plot, love the themes and I especially love how each character had something to offer to catch the audience attention almost immediately. Thumbs up to Whedon great job."

Your movie if you like Marvel's superheroes.","The Avengers is a great action movie people of all ages would enjoy, especially geeks and fans of comics. Hulk, Thor, Captain America, Iron Man, and others are all in it! The movie is action-packed, with amazing special effects, but with the traditional storyline one would expect from similar films. However, it is not the storyline that defines this movie, but the rich interactions of all these superhero characters as they try to work together to save the world.The Avengers is entertaining, with many funny moments, one-liners, unexpected events, and even long fights between the superheroes themselves. However, the movie progresses very slowly, which is a bit frustrating for a movie packed with superstars and a runtime of two hours and 23 minutes. Although I appreciate the director's work in taking enough time to present the unique and complex personality of every character in the story. The cast also does a great job with the characters, and each of the superheroes gets their own chance to shine throughout the story, although you can see the director's unique passion towards the Iron Man and Hulk characters -- Joss Whedon wrote the screenplay and directed the film.In short, the movie is long, but great! And if you like Marvel's superheroes, this is definitely THE movie for you!"

The first 30 minutes or so seemed a bit slow to me. And dark (as in, pass me the remote, I want to adjust the brightness). I'm a dyed-in-the-wool Downey/Ironman fan so the other characters left me a bit cold but the excellent one-liners and SFX kept me interested. Scarlett Johanssen was impressive eye candy and her Black Widow persona grew on me. Neat little things: The brief appearances of the new Honda NSX and Stan Lee, who I thought showed up at the end of the movie and said something like, "Super heroes in New York City - ridiculous!". Can anyone confirm it was him?"

Sign in to vote.,"The Avengers is a well made movie for superhero fans.",""The Avengers" is an action packed film that was well made and has wonderful graphics and special effects. The plot was easy to follow and the story was not too complex. It was a very easy movie to relax and watch. Along with all the action in this film, there was also a sense of humor in the way of the interactions between characters. However, I was not personally a fan of this film. In order to understand the characters and relations among characters, the viewer has to have background knowledge of superheroes, and past superhero films. I have never seen any sort of superhero movie before so watching this film was not an enjoyable experience. While I enjoyed the graphics and action in this movie, it was very hard to follow and understand.The main goal in this film was to protect and keep the Tesseract, a main source of power, safe. Near the beginning of the film, the Tessearct was taken by a villain named Loki and his army. Throughout the film the team of superheroes comprised of Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Hawkeye and Black Widow work together to get the Tesseract back in their hands to prevent a disaster. If the Tesseract fell into the wrong hands, it could cause great damage because of the amount of power it holds involving global security. The main plot of the story revolves around the superheroes working to get the Tesseract back from Loki. Loki and his army came from a different world in order to retrieve the Tesseract from the Avengers. The Avengers knew how important it was to keep the Tesseract in this world because of its immense power. Various conflicts occur throughout the film between the Avengers and Loki and his army. As the story comes to an end there is a very large battle between Loki's army and the Avengers. At the end of the film one of the sides ends up defeating the other and earns the Tesseract. It was very hard to understand the relations among these characters and how they worked together based on their past because of the lack of character development. Without knowledge of these superheroes and their relationships, it was near to impossible to understand how they interacted with each other. I was very confused during one of the conflicts because Thor and the Hulk began to fight each other. I did not know that these two superheroes do not get along, so I was very confused as to why they were fighting each other instead of trying to win the Tesseract back. If the characters were more developed and explained in the rising action of the movie, I believe I would have enjoyed it much more. This movie is a wonderful choice for a viewer that is keen on their knowledge of different superheroes, but if the viewer does not know much about superheroes I would not recommend this movie."

Sign in to vote.,"4 1/2 Stars","ReviewJoss Whedon is often jokingly referred to as "God of the Nerds" but his title is apt considering his ludicrously extensive experience in the so-called "geek" genre. The creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, and Firefly, Joss Whedon has been knee-deep in the nerd world since he began directing and writing in 1997. A widely popular aficionado of the comic book world, he has been known for his unique characters, stories, and usage of cheap practical effects instead of heavy CGI; though he is an accomplished director, it still came as a welcome surprise for comic book fans everywhere when he was chosen to direct the comic-book movie of a lifetime: Marvel's The Avengers.Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow, Hawkeye and Iron Man: these are The Avengers, Earth's Mightiest Heroes. It was the opportunity of a lifetime for Marvel to undertake the daunting endeavor of bringing all these well-known heroes together in one feature film. This type of movie had never been made before; it consisted of a legion of famous actors that all had to be balanced perfectly with an interesting plot with running over each other or crowding the big screen. When Marvel announced in July of 2010, fanboys everywhere breathed a collective sigh of relief. Of course, there was some doubt due to his inexperience with such strong actors and a huge budget, but Joss Whedon, of all people, was going to get it right.The creator of Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog promised a spectacular show, and he delivered with compliments. The Avengers went on to be one of the top grossing films of all time, shattering records by flimsy franchises such as Harry Potter, Twilight, and Titanic. The Avengers received praise from a wealth of critics, highlighting the powerful storytelling, camaraderie between actors, special effects, and intense actions sequences that paid homage to its heavy comic book origins while remaining grounded in reality. I personally have seen the fil over seven times and each time I notice new nuances in the plot and little "easter eggs", or special treats a director inserts into a film that only true believers notice. Unlike anything ever done before, The Avengers blends dozens of famous actors into an engaging plot full of action that is contrasted by the subtle points of human reflection and punctuated by brilliant special effects and superb acting. Yes, Joss Whedon promised a comic-book movie like never before, and he surpassed even my expectations. In truth, this masterpiece of pop culture and cinematography leaves only one thing left to say: Avengers Assemble!"

He looked more real and lean. Avengers Hulk looked more bulking. Being in the gym as a weightlifter and a runner, I know how a runners physique looks like. Hulk runs,crushes, jumps, and does a lot of running. His physical ability to me does not fit with a bulky look. I hope your future movies get more thought before putting on film. Can not wait to see your future films. I hope you keep the same actors for these films. Actor that played in Avengers was more appealing to me than the 2008 film.

The Avengers is a movie based on the Marvel's comic book. It is like continuation of Marvel's previous movies like Iron man, Thor, Hulk, Captain America and assembling the different superheroes in one mega-blockbuster extravaganza. The script is well written, the characters are fantastic along with their action, one-liners and jokes are hilarious. Action is the best part designed and given by the Marvel. Loki, at the end of the "Thor" movie will fall into somewhere and meet one ally, promises them for a deal in return for favor of becoming King of Asgard. S.H.I.E.L.D. leader Nick Fury and the various superheroes included in his Avengers Initiative.

A lot of what needs to be done here will have to be done quietly, without any discussion, using any means at our disposal to achieve our objective." – Dick Cheney"The more powerful the class, the more it claims not to exist, and its power is employed above all to enforce this claim." - Guy DebordChris Nolan's "Dark Knight" stars Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne, a millionaire weapons contractor who moonlights as Batman, a powerful superhero who beats up terrorists. Politically, some critics believe the film to be advocating the suspension of democracy in a time of terror. Others see it as endorsing scepticism of a leader's claims to free reign during a "state of emergency" (which is often the leader's own creation).The truth is, the film presents the usual two-party, false binary present year after election year. Batman and politician Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) represent the opposite poles of so-called democratic politics. Batman, operating outside the law to protect the defenceless people of Gotham City, represents your typical Bush/Cheney/Nixon cryptofascist, rationalising what he does (torture, law breaking etc) for the "good of the homeland". Kipling called this the "white man's burden"; men rationalise their evil as a noble and necessary burden which must be righteously carried so as to spare others the load. Dent, meanwhile, along with one Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal), are idealistic, by-the-books types. Both learn to be "pragmatic" and collaborate with vigilantes (Batman), if only to take down bad guys. Batman, Dent thinks, has become a necessity.The film really tips its ideological hand during its Greek-tragedy final hour. Dawes, the most liberal of all the "good guys", dies at the hands of a terrorist called Joker (Heath Ledger), whilst the pragmatist Dent, scarred in war, abandons his ideals and embraces the Joker's ethos of chaos. In other words, we must accept the cold embrace of Batman if we want to be secure. Dent's law abiding idealism doesn't work. It's two faced and is merely a mask for chaos and disorder.The Joker, with his Al-Qaeda like video recordings, his constant attacks on "women and children" and his advocacy of terrorism and chaos, is a figure who stands propagandistically for "America's enemies". IE- America's enemies are not an oppressed and exploited, diverse and divided group trying with futility to resist in various ways, but rather, they are a fundamentally irrational, monstrous, chaotic and lawless cult of death. Thus, the Joker offers only the wild, amoral, killing life beyond the protective (and expansionist) borders of "democracy" (aka corporatist imperialism).The moral is as old, and as conservative, as Hobbes. The film says we can live in a wild, murderous wasteland OR a lawless, authoritarian police state. It doesn't matter which of these options the film presents as more appealing or fun, all that matters is that no other options present themselves. This false binary, rife with straw-men, is the complete opposite to something like "Hellboy 2", where our superheroes retire once they realise that the government for which they've been working ultimately opposes the difference and diversity they represent. Compared to "Dark Knight", this is genuinely radical.Late in the film, Joker places a massive bet on the assumption that most people are as viciously indifferent to other human beings as he is. The Batman's counter-bet is that people are devoted to morals, order and authority. Batman wins, an act which serves not to celebrate Gothan's morality, but to legitimise the Dark Knight.The bad guys themselves are an assortment of freaks and ethnic minorities while the good guys are, with the exception of slave boy Morgan Freeman, uptight bourgeois white Americans. The most virtuous of them is the "Great White Hope", Harvey Dent. Harvey, though his crusade against crime is on the legal side, secretly loves Batman's underground campaign of terror and Guantanamo Bay styled "free reign". In fact, Gotham police relies on Batman to break legs, smash faces, interrogate and torture on their behalf. And Batman, with enormous resources at his disposal, doesn't shirk from breaking international law to abduct a Chinese target or from erecting a colossal surveillance machine which makes Bush's extensive illegal wiretapping and water-boardings look lame. This subplot of the film is particularly insidious in light of the NSA's illegal PRISM, ECHELON and MUSCULAR surveillance programmes, ostensibly to "stop terrorists", but really to aid big business, spying on financial ministers, charities, leftists etc. In short, Batman is bad simply because the state can't afford to be seen being bad. What's odd is that Batman's struggle is not a collective one. The few members of the public who do try to "copycat" Batman's antics end up being butchered.To protect Gotham, Batman and the police eventually create serial lies and myths for public consumption. It's the "noble lie" which the masses need to sustain their morale. In other words, leaders (Bush, Nixon etc) are self-righteously willing to be seen as immoral, under the understanding that you understand that what they do they do, Christ-like, for you. They protect us from Joker. Of course in the real world the nature of Joker is covered up, and Batman does nothing but enhance his own material wealth and power by way of the Joker's shocks to Gotham's system. And so the "Knight" boils down to age old authoritarian motives: in order to have social stability you need a lie. The real hero of the film is actually the Joker, but the film's PG13 rating prevents it from dealing with this seriously. I'll take the Joker's anarchistic chaos over Batman's archaic commitment to corrupt systems of law and order any day. Not only that, Joker's psycho ramblings and burning towers of cash are infinitely more entertaining than Batman's Multi-million Dollar Extreme Warfare Batmobile.6/10 - Popcorn fascism. Despite a strong first half, "Knight's" second half drowns in messily shot action and needless subplots. See "Die Hard 3"."

9,31-Jul-08,Chrysanthepop,8,17,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"Batman v/s The Joker","Finally the wait is over. Quite obviously, 'The Dark Knight' is THE most waited film of Summer 2008. It is indeed an exciting action film but, in addition, it does delve deeper than the common action movies. What really makes 'The Dark Knight' stand out is the writing (especially the dialogues which are clever, amusing and thought-provoking), performances and of course, it is the skilled Christopher Nolan's direction that puts it all together, telling an exciting story. It's got substance and the themes are well presented. This time Batman's character is a lot more complex as he's faced with contradicting situations of which he has to make a choices. The character is a good 'continuation' from the prequel (where he's just started with the new identity whereas now he faces the disadvantages and complexities of being Batman).While the writers deserve all the praise for brilliantly defining the characters, it is the actor's job to bring them to life and credit goes to Nolan for retaining most of the better actors of 'Batman Begins' (namely Bale, Freeman and the one and only Caine) and the new cast includes a host of great names like Eckhart, Gyllenhaal, Oldman and of course Ledger. Christian Bale excellently carries off Wayne/Batman. In my opinion, his Batman is much more convincing and intriguing than what Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer and George Clooney offered. Maggie Gyllenhaal is obviously a tremendous improvement over Katie Holmes (the worst thing in 'Batman Begins'). She maintains a great chemistry with Bale and Eckhart and is far from the typical damsel in distress. Aaron Eckhart is totally awesome and Gary Oldman, Eric Roberts and Michael Caine (always dependable) hold their own and do nothing short of a great job. A barely recognizable Heath Ledger delivers a memorable last performance. He reminded me of the late Brandon Lee in 'The Crow'. His Joker is menacing, wickedly funny, insane and cunning. I especially liked that he always said that he didn't plan anything (when this was clearly a lie).The energy-filled action scenes are plentiful and well executed. The dramatic sequences are well balanced and convincing. The cinematography and sound effects are very effective and the score works fantastically.The only downers for me were that the pace wasn't steady as it gets slightly slow towards the end. Bale's Batman voice was overdone. I can understand that the voice needed to sound different from Bruce Wayne's but this one sounded too awkward and too artificial. I would have liked to see how Rachel's death affected Batman. Nolan demonstrates well how it influences Harvey but not much of how Batman dealt with it (especially since it was the consequence of a choice he made). Yet, overall, it is a very well executed film that is darkly entertaining and exciting. I can understand why so many love it."

A true Masterpiece of the decade!","So today I finally went to see The Dark Knight, and my theater going experience was probable the best I ever had.The opening of the film is brilliant, a clever way to grab the audience. The sound in my theater was very loud, and the gunshots were very well done, the sound. Anyways, from the start of the film, it does not play out like a superhero film. I thought it was very complex, like an attorney or law film. It certainly grabs you into a world created only by Christopher Nolan. His screenplay lets you wonder into all this crime in Gotham. Every scene helps into characterization to all the characters. The cinematography is amazing. Nolan does not waste any beauty of Chicago, or 'Gotham', go to waste. He plays with the settings, and in a way presents us with beautiful city lights and skyscrapers, in a way that actually no film ever did. The action pieces are all well done, and actually, unlike Batman Begins, they are very well directed and the camera work helps. That's a huge improvement.Now to an important piece of this film, the acting. Of course, the key performance is Ledger, and what can I say, he does not disappoint at all. What he gives us here is a villain so menacing, so complex, so insane that it ranks up there with Hannibal Lector. Heath Ledger's performance is definitely in the top 5 of the decade, and it deserves to be remembered, and also an Oscar. His facial expressions, his grins, his chilling laugh, his tone, everything is perfect. The other actors also all shine. Performances that I think deserve some buzz too, are Aaaron Eckhart and Gary Oldman. Eckhart, who plays the district attorney Harvery Dent really surprised me. I think since Ledger has been given all the buzz, they forgot Eckhart. Well, he deserves some too, not as much as Ledger, but he really was great. Gary Oldman is an underrated actor, and I also think he shines. Christian Bale does another great job of the hero that people fear and have doubts about. Maggie Gyllenhall, does a better job of playing Rachel Dawes than Katie Holmes, but she is not in the film as much, but does play it very well. Of course, brilliant actors, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman do great supporting performances with their limited time. All the other smaller performances playing cops, detectives, and thugs are all great as well.What makes this film truly gold is the amazing intense moments and the unpredictability. There are amazing action scenes, but the reason they shine so much is because of how well they are built up, and how all of a sudden they come. More frequently toward the last hour of the film, it takes a lot of deadly turns and places that not many films go too. First off, when Harvey Dent declares he is Batman, and how he is taken in the GPD car, and how The Joker just comes out of nowhere. All of a sudden, the Joker is in custody, and right after one of the most amazingly acted, most intense scenes I have seen in years(Joker interrogated by Batman) we find out not one, but TWO important characters are in danger, and the game Batman has to play is choose one. Well, me already knowing who would die, I was still so nervous, and a lot of viewers were too. They were so captivated and lingered, I wanted to use the bathroom but for an hour I could not stand up. That is the making of pure films. It kept us glued to our seats. The scenes with the two boats, I was so nervous, and in the final scene with Two-face getting Gordon's son and threatening his life, it was so intense, more intense than recent crime movies.Overall, this is not just the best superhero film ever made, but one of the best films of the decade. I do not think it is one of those films that need to be called masterpieces, because only time will tell, and some people have called it that, and some said it's not. The problem is that The Dark Knight does have some material, like too many characters, too many situations, some unimportant characters, that are it's flaws, but I truly believe that they helped us identify with Gotham more, and even though it has it's negatives, it really does not impact the viewer. The Dark Knight can be called a crime/thriller/mystery/horror/law/action epic blockbuster! It certainly has themes of all those genres, and the reason is because of one truly unforgettably character-The Joker. But the film by itself is also amazing. Probably the funnest, most intense experience I ever had in a theater. Having seen Memento last night, this film is just as amazing as that one in different ways. It is so ambitious, it is a good thing in this case.Deeserves some real Oscar mention, since its more than a superhero film!"

I tend not to be into comic book films etc, but this was a very entertaining and action packed piece, with memorable characters and a decent plot. The Joker, of course, is the star of the film. I've never been a fan of the late Heath Ledger's films, but in this he was outstanding. The menace he conveyed was brilliant and he stole the film in every respect. Christian Bale made a good, understated batman, and there were good performances by the bloke playing Two Face and also Michael Caine. In England there has been plenty of controversy that the film was given a 12A rating, but I don't see why the Daily Mail is so insanely frothing at the mouth. Yes, its quite a violent film, but the actual attacks/incidents are not generally shown on-screen, more alluded to or the camera pans away etc. One scene in which the Joker stabs a man in the face was skilfully edited for impact, but wasn't gory as we didn't see any blood and so on. Overall, a brilliant film. My only criticism was that it was a tad too long, but I'd still happily buy it when it comes out on DVD."

Sign in to vote.,"Better than Begins (spoilers throughout)","The Dark Knight is an improvement on Batman Begins, but it's not the giant leap that people would have you believe. It has too many flaws. The final sequence, for example, is a gigantic mess. Every attempt is made to ensure that it's exciting, but the editing is all over the place and sometimes its not even clear what's going on.Then there's Two-Face. What a dull creation he is. Basically his girlfriend gets killed and he goes a bit nuts and then he goes on a killing spree. Sounds kind of interesting, doesn't it? It's not. The stuff with Harvey Dent previous to this is enjoyable, but Two-Face himself sucks a lot of the life out of the film. And that's probably because it's over too quickly. All Two-Face gets to do is whine, toss his little coin and then fall out of a building. It's over in a flash and you're left wondering why create this villain at all if you're going to do so little with him.And the make-up and CGI for his disfigured face is awful. The film goes to such lengths to create a realistic environment for these fantastical characters that the cartoony effects stick out like a sore thumb. I can remember reading somewhere that Nolan thought that a realistically scarred face would look too horrific, but he could have at least gone for something that didn't look like it was on an anatomy page in Encarta.And I was also distracted by Batman's cowl. It has a very weird shape, like Bale's head is the teat on the end of a condom, albeit it a black condom with bat ears. It's nowhere near as good as Keaton's costume in Batman Returns.But what did I like about the film? Well, pretty much everything else. It's mind-numbingly predictable to point to Heath Ledger's performance as the highlight, but it's most certainly true. His Joker makes Nicholson's look like a slightly eccentric, rather cuddly uncle. Ledger blows him out of the water.The best thing about Ledger's Joker is that there's no reasoning with him. He just wants to play his games and have a laugh. However, he has a very strange sense of fun. Fun for him is playing with the Batman and turning Gotham's citizens into criminals. He's a guy that gets nothing out of money or sex. Therefore it's impossible to squeeze him.The only problem with this is that it weakens Batman's character. You go through a whole film to establish how strong he is and suddenly you cut his testes off. In this film he's remarkably impotent. And it also must be pointed out that the Joker is smart to a ridiculous degree. His plans are incredibly complicated and they all go off like clockwork.But that being said, the character is still enormous fun. One of my favourite Joker moments has to be the pencil trick. Yep, that pencil really did disappear. And what about poor Brian the fake Batman? Not only does he get to star in his own video, but he also gets to smash into the Mayor's window. Nice.But it's also the small moments that make Ledger's performance great. I like it when he arrives at Bruce Wayne's party, looking for Harvey Dent. He begins interrogating the guests and grabs a bald guy by the head, asking him if he's seen the DA. The guy doesn't respond and the Joker widens his eyes and goes, 'No.' It's a great bit of acting. And I also loved it when he applauds Gordon's promotion.The rest of the cast don't get to have anywhere near as much fun, but they all do a good job. Bale is solid as always, as is Caine, Freeman and Oldman, and Maggie Gyllenhaal is a massive improvement over Katie Holmes. But better than all of these is Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent. He's cocky but believably decent as the incorruptible DA, and like Bruce Wayne you're seduced by him. But while you feel that the film is building up to something special with his tragedy as Two-Face, it never happens. Suddenly the script lets Eckhart down and his fall provides zero emotion. There's just not enough time invested in it. It could have been a whole film in itself.Fortunately, though, there are many wonderful distractions to ensure that you don't dwell too hard on this disappointment. The action, for instance, is superb. And once again Nolan excels with a wonderful car chase.However, my favourite bit in the whole film is a very small moment. Right after the Joker escapes from police custody we briefly see him hanging his body out of a squad car. There's no sound and the music is no more than a hum, but it's incredibly cinematic and says more about the character than almost anything else could. This is what makes the Joker's life worth living; running rings around other people and playing games with them.And Nolan must also be commended for some of the film's subtext. The Joker's videos kind of resemble the sorts of things Al Qaeda would make and the whole film asks how far would you go to try and re-establish control. Do you destroy everything you believe in just so that things can be the way they used to be? Of course this is the crisis that America faces where civil liberties are eroded in order to try and make the country 'safer'. The Dark Knight just takes it to an extreme.So while Nolan must be commended for the ambition of the project and for most of the film's execution, it's by no means the instant masterpiece it's been touted as. Yes it's the best Batman film that's been made, but it's not even close to being the best film of all time."

9,11-Aug-08,johngammon56,8,17,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"Maybe not such a good film as others would lead you to believe","I hate to say it, since so many others have found this film excellent, but I found myself rather glad when it ended. I was a big comics fan as a child and still read graphic novels, so that's not the problem.First, I felt that the characters were rather two dimensional and leant far too heavily on the acting of the excellent cast. Some of them, notably Morgan Freeman, may have well have had their eyeballs painted on their eyelids, so routine was their contribution. A lot of this lack of character came from the plot's being needlessly complicated, ruining any chance of genuine suspense: time and again set pieces felt rushed through to get on to the next thing. The best part – the Joker's two bomb, two ship conundrum – could have been the centrepiece of the last section of the film and could have built up some tension through the development of the characters on the boat, but this scene was used and dumped. Nolan should have really cut back on the spectacle and invested more time on people, as the earlier Christopher Reeve Superman movies tried to do: in this movie, there were simply too many things going on. There's nothing in this film, nothing at all, that hasn't been done over and over again in previous films. This film might do it better, but the incidents are still hackneyed. I wouldn't mind though, if any of the constant crises of the plot had any point. Blowing up a hospital probably was a great effect, but did it advance the plot or the characters? There could have been plenty of tension in the practicalities of having the very ill patients being moved and the Batman having to help when say he should have been somewhere else, maybe saving his girlfriend. Instead in a rather old fashioned manner Batman kept turning up often without any explanation, like the cavalry. (Indeed, Batman zips off at the end cornily like the Lone Ranger.) The lack of character interest in the film was particularly apparent in the film's casual attitude towards violence, with seemingly hundreds of people being shot and killed and forgotten about as in a video game, not to mention scenes of torture in police custody that in the context of the film was put forward, surprisingly given Guantanamo etc, as a good thing. This led to the viewer not really caring about anybody in the cast or what happened to them. I didn't care for the tasteless use of knives on the part of the Joker, but this has a particular resonance for people here in Britain at the moment, and seems to be a lot more troubling area for us than probably for American filmmakers.While the Tim Burton version of Batman was set in a kind of art deco fantasy, which to my mind worked better, this film was set in a recognisably real city. This led to the various sillinesses of comic book movies being more obvious and irritating. Why for example would you design a car with a hidden motorbike? How can you fall off a tall building onto a car from penthouse to ground level and not kill yourself? (Indeed, how can you glide with a cape in the first place?) How does the Joker recruit anyone to his gang when he deliberately murders them during jobs? And why when his lover dies, a woman he's supposed to have known from childhood, does Bruce Wayne not even bother to go to the funeral? More worryingly, why are men and women's roles in Gotham City seemingly no further ahead than the 1950s? (For instance, when her children are menaced by Two-Face, here was a great opportunity for the minor character Mrs Gordon to have a few surprising and challenging lines - instead she doesn't say anything.) As in so many movies these days, the effects and technical quality were excellent. My difficulty is just that for me this film was like watching a poor children's animation – well-made but unreal, uninvolving, with no character interest, and if longer than 20 minutes a bit tiresome. Fair enough if you like that kind of thing, but would any of the undoubtedly many fans of this film really want to watch it more than once?"

Sign in to vote.,"What were they thinking?!","Okay,first of all, I would like to thank Warner Brothers for making the most overrated movie ever made. How Can people compare this to the Burton Batman movie or the Godfather? Or Fight Club? Those are some of the best movies ever made. This is what it's come too. After watching good movies (Terminator, Total Recall, BTTF, Star wars, and the Godfather etc.) and god awful movies (Catwoman, Batman Begins, Toxic Avenger, Troll 2, BTTF 3, Alien 3, Terminator 3 and 4) I had to watch the worst, most overrated piece of crap to hit the big screen. Let's compare some of the elements of the Michael Keaton Batman and this piece of crap that i'm reviewing: The plot holes: 1989 Batman: the story of how Bruce Wayne became Batman, how Jack Naiper became the joker. Both of which were plot holes, but interesting none the less. The Dark Knight: bland side stories of stuff like Batman and Rachel Dawes's relationship, the the creation of two face, etc.The Clown Prince of crime himself: In "Batman," the Joker (Nicholson) was a psychotic, yet funny villain who had creative methods i.e. Smylex (the Joker Gas), that hand buzzer thing, and the acid squirting flower. He was the best part of the movie. In the Dark Knight, the Joker is some psychotic anarchist who just blows up stuff. Big freaking whoop. And the only reason people like the Heath Ledger Joker is because Heath Ledger died after the movie was finished.Batman: In the batman movie I liked, Michael Keaton delivered a halfway decent performance in both of the movies he was in. In the dark knight, batman was some queer who was pathetically trying to make a futile attempt at sounding intimidating. It's almost laughable. He always sounds like he's choking!!! And there were none of the batman gadgets used in the 1989 one. Batman in the dark knight was a boring, pathetic queer.The plot and setting: In the 1989 Batman movie, the way Gotham City was described was very cool. However in the dark knight, it was a generic of Chicago.If you don't like good movies, and like overrated movies, and like watching shitty films. I highly recommend the dark knight."

Sign in to vote.,"Imax format is the only way to see it","I watched "The Dark Knight" in IMAX today my second viewing of the film in Austin, Texas. I had only seen one other IMAX film prior to this a documentary about Antarctica at Paramount's great America in Santa Clara California. I can truthfully say that I have never had my jaw drop open as I did with this. The IMAX scenes are stunning and add an almost David Lean like spectacle. In fact in an odd way it reminded me of "Lawrence of Arabia" Both TE Lawrence and Batman were men who were tormented by various psychoses and both became unconventional heroes. Lawrence, like Batman was both a hero to some and a villain to others. And like Batman both had personal traumas that shaped who they were, Bruce Wayne witnessing the murder of his parents and Lawrence being sodomized by the brutal Turkish bey. The brilliance of Leans masterpiece was that it also was a character study as well as an epic drama. TDK is much the same way. Film is after all a visual medium first and foremost. Nolan's imagery is almost operatic and especially in the truck sequence. It is so visceral so alive and so kinetic that it makes for one of the most exciting sequences in years rivaling the truck chase in Terminator 2. I will not waste any more time talking about the actors, particularly Heath Ledger as the Joker. I can add nothing new here. Seen in Imax format however he becomes more than just a man but a demonic force. His first scene when he takes off the clown makeup is sweeping. His visage fills the entire screen and the clarity of the format is such that you can see the rot of his face which reflects his rotting soul. The sequence in Hong Kong shot almost entirely in IMAX is a masterpiece of editing and cinematography. Nolan has created an epic crime drama as well as a Faustian drama. The joker has not just sold his soul to the devil he's the devil personified. Batman almost loses his soul. The film in the end is about choices. The choices we make every day. Throughout the film characters are given choices to make. The joker chooses anarchy and chaos over harmony. Batman chooses to save Rachel and in the end loses her. The passengers on the ferries are given a choice. The citizens of Gotham are given the choice to kill the man who knows Batman's identity. And in the end Batman makes the ultimate choice. He chooses in Alfred's words to "make the choice that no one else will have to face." And of course both the Joker and Batman made monumental choices in their pasts that shaped who they were. Batman chose the path of good and the joker chose the path of evil. The film shows how making choices for better or for worse can have profound impacts on our everyday lives. It also shows how the line between heroism and madness is sometimes very thinly drawn. The best comic book movie to date and one of the best movies of the year with the most thrilling ending in recent memory."

9,7-Jan-10,John_Truby,2,3,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"A writer's movie well worth a study","For anyone who wants to look beneath its action surface, The Dark Knight proves that a movie can be a huge hit because of theme, not in spite of it.The Dark Knight is the closest thing to a fictional exploration of moral philosophy to come out of Hollywood in a long time, and that includes No Country for Old Men. Amazingly, writers Jonathan Nolan, Christopher Nolan, and David Goyer create this complex moral expression on the foundation of superhero action crime genre.The writers begin their elegant construction with the depiction of the main character, Batman, and here they had a tremendous advantage going in. Of all superhero characters, Batman highlights and consistently questions the very concept of the hero and the savior. He is truly a dark knight, concerned with justice but also willing to use illegal and immoral means to achieve it.He is also deeply aware of the negative effects a savor can have on the general populace. He knows, and probably believes in, the great moral principle of "If you see the Buddha, kill the Buddha." But he is unable to live the principle when faced with so much injustice. And when, in The Dark Knight, the bad guys escalate their evil acts, Batman is dragged into a war of tit for tat that soils everyone. Interestingly, Batman's garbled voice has a strange resemblance to Clint Eastwood's, especially in his Dirty Harry films.In the Blockbuster story development software, we place a lot of emphasis on the "character web," and The Dark Knight uses this crucial technique to perfection. The first character to be compared to Batman is the main opponent, The Joker. A lot has been written about Heath Ledger's terrific performance. But we need to look at what he built his performance on, and that is found in the script. Non-writers might think I'm referring to the dialogue, but I'm not. The writers constructed this character to drive two major story elements, the moral argument (theme) and the plot.The classic crime story is based on a master criminal who believes he is above the law and society itself. The Joker is just such a character, a genius psychopath whose massive intellect is shown not so much in dialogue as in his ability to plot. He accuses Dent and Batman of being schemers. But in fact he is the master schemer, a modern Moriarty, who acts, not out of greed or revenge, but for the game. And he is better at the game than anyone else, so much so that we have the rare example of a story with too much plot.The Joker is literally the author of Gotham City, constructing criminal plots that will remake the city to express his moral vision. Many have called The Joker a nihilist, a man in love with chaos. But this is a serious misreading. If Batman is the Dark Knight, The Joker is the Dark Philosopher. The entire plot of The Dark Knight is a series of moral conundrums The Joker creates to expose what he believes is the true animal nature of mankind. Tracking the beats of the crime story that goes all the way back to its originator, Crime and Punishment, The Joker creates ever more difficult versions of the genre's central question: What would you do if you had to choose between two bad options? First, does Batman expose his true identity or let the Joker kill someone every day? Then does he let Dent take the risk of getting killed to pull The Joker out of hiding? Does he save Rachel, his true love, or Dent, the righteous hope of the city? Does he listen in on the entire city in order to save a few? For the film's final choice, the writers use the classic Prisoner's Dilemma, central to game theory and moral philosophy. In Prisoner's Dilemma, two prisoners suspected of a crime are placed in separate cells. Each is given the following choice: If you both remain silent, you both get only six months in jail. If you both confess, you both get 5 years. If you remain silent but your partner confesses, he goes free and you get 10 years in jail. As you can see, the only real choice each person can make is to confess, since neither can risk the harsh 10-year sentence trusting that his partner will remain silent.In The Dark Knight, two ships filled with passengers are given the choice of pushing a button to blow up the other ship before a time deadline, at which point both ships will be destroyed. This sets up a unique battle in which not only two forces but also two entire moral systems are brought into opposition. The battle is marred only by the fact that the writers don't play true to the reality about human beings they have carefully crafted throughout the film. In other words, the people on the boats don't make the believable choice.Though The Dark Knight has too much plot, resulting in a movie that is at least 20 minutes too long, its plot is worth studying to see masters at work. These writers use a vast array of plot techniques, and a lot of professional writers I know, while bemoaning so many false endings, have said the plotting is what they studied the most. Ironically, one of the main techniques these writers use is character web, proving again that at the deepest level of good storytelling, plot and character are the same. I've already mentioned the plotting power the main opponent brings to the story. But plot also comes from the second lead, Harvey Dent, as well as a number of other characters who appear to be friends but are really enemies, or appear to be enemies but are really friends.To Continue reading, and for more reviews, please visit http://www.truby.com/dk.html"

Sign in to vote.,"Dark","Christopher Nolan has taken the comic-adaptation genre to a new height, nay, has created a new genre out of comics – the comics tragedy, and no oxymoron here.The Joker is the "hero" in this movie, not Batman, with due respect to Christian Bale's excellent performance. But if Bale's performance is excellent, Heath Ledger's is monumental – who else can make Jack Nicholson look like an amateur performing the same role? But, let's be fair though. Nicholson was directed by Tim Burton to play The Joker as a comic caricature. Ledger played the character as a psychopathic anarchist, with a grim, macabre intensity that sends a shudder down your spine every time he speaks. Some even say that this role cost this great (with The Joker, Ledger has earned this honorific) actor his life. Christian Bale, with his appropriately non-heroic persona, takes Batman so much further into the realm of shade that the title is fully justified. This is on two plains. Visually, we have never seen a Batman that is so literally dark – even the logo is all but noticeable. Deep inside, Bruce Wayne is pushed to the limits as The Joker challenges his bottom line, questions his very identity. And I believe that Joker has won – in the prison cell where his is held, the bashing Batman administers on him look like something you see in "Rendition". Top-notch actor Aaron Eckhart brings yet another dimension to this excellent sequel. Here's a man that Bruce West yearns to be, a fighter for justice that is not afraid to show his face. The fact that D.A. Harvey Dent also happens to be a rival for Rachel Dawes is another sore point. Dent, however, is a hero out of the Greek Tragedies, destined for a horrible fate.Even the supporting roles are much more watchable than many lead roles in lesser movies. Thank heavens they have found someone who can act to play Rachel – Maggie Gyllenhaal brings to the somewhat plain character charm and zest all of her of her own. Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and Cillian Murphy are all actors who can carry a movie singlehandedly by themselves. As seasoned professionals, they provide first class support without trying to steal the scenes from the lead actors.While acting is what distinguishes the movie, all the things that make for a good action thriller are there, and Nolan's masterful direction ensures a good balance. With just about everything going right for this movie, if it were to be remembered by only one thing, it will unquestionably Heath Ledger as The Joker."

Sign in to vote.,"The best made downer film of the decade . . .","Great directing, cinematography, acting, special effects, sound, etc. A lot of unarmed, innocent, good people die in this film. In fact, the hero of this story isn't really a hero, he ends up the villain because he takes responsibility for Two faces crimes and the Joker, after killing countless people (including Bruce Wayne's girl friend) essentially gets away. The Joker and his henchmen are on screen a lot more than the good guys. Furthermore, Batman mostly looks like an ignorant half witted fool - not to mention childish and self absorbed. Aside from the quality of the films production what's in it for the viewer? NOTHING. You walk out of the theater depressed. The Joker is A LOT smarter than Batman. Again, Batman is a feckless clod in comparison - even with all his money and gadgets the Joker kills and kills and kills. Then kills some more and gets arrested - but he's already escaped the police and out smarted them many times so we know he's only just getting started. Why go to the next movie? We already know what is going to happen. The bad guys will kill more innocent people and get away with it - and they'll not pay for their crimes. That is apparently what sells today.This film is for people who like the bad guys to win. If you like sick twisted murderous bastards to get away with what ever they please - you'll love Batman - The Dark Knight. But the movie should be named The Joker - Killer of the Innocent. I won't be attending the next Batman - I like the good guys to win."

Chris Nolan has done a fantastic job, and this movie has to go down in the history books and the best superhero movie EVER!!! As for the actors, Christian Bale is spectacular. He's the perfect man for the perfect role-Batman. He fits into the role so well. Michael Caine, a charismatic, classy and charming butler who is as much a butler as a mentor and guardian to a young man desperate for a path to pursue to save the people he loves. Caine is tremendously good. Morgan Freeman, as always, terrific. His version of James Bond's Q is much more realistic and captivating.The real star of the show, as everyone's been saying, is of course the late Heath Ledger. He's sooooooooooooooooo good!!!!!!!! the scene with the pencil trick is awesome, i never expected it and it hit me with a BANG!! it's impossible to be that good, but he's proved it's not. He's taken villainy to a whole new level. It's such a tragedy that he has died. I think he could've been as good as the legendary Marlon Brando and Co. Aaron Eckhart is good throughout the film and he's given a good all-round performance. i hoped that Harvey Dent's fate would be different because they didn't need to introduce another villain in this movie. The Joker is more than enough of a villain for this film. The cinematography is exemplary and deserves many rounds of applause. This movie is definitely the best movie of 2008. it's also probably one of the best movies i've ever seen (and i'm a big movie buff)although i look forward to Helboy:The Golden Army."

Sign in to vote.,"Dark, Dramatic and Excellently Cast","The first thing I want to say about Dark Knight is that this is most definitely NOT one for the kids. It really appalls me when I see small kids at movies like this (which I did), and I can't even begin to imagine what their parents are thinking. I remember enough about my own childhood to know that the image of Harvey Dent's face burning and his subsequent disfigurement would have stayed with me a very long time. And children will not 'get' the moral ambiguity of the plot. Much has been written about the unrelenting violence of the movie. But violence on screen is not necessarily a bad thing, it just needs to be watched by the appropriate audience, and with this Batman movie, personally I don't think that includes children under 12 or 13.Leaving aside doubts about the certification, this is a very good film, although it is unremittingly dark and totally lacking in any kind of light relief. It's gripping, well edited and has a complex but comprehensible story arc and well written dialogue. And, most important for me, the special effects are excellent but they don't overshadow the characters and the human interest. From Batman flying among the high rises of Hong Kong to the truck tipping end over end on a Gotham City street and the hospital blowing up, the effects are terrific but what grips us still is the interplay of the people and the dilemmas they face, not the size of the explosions. I usually object to movies running at much over 2 hours, but I barely noticed how long this was; it had me completely engrossed from start to finish. The story, described extensively elsewhere, sees Batman joining forces with the police (Lt Gordon) and Gotham's clean cut, new DA Harvey Dent to round up the criminals in Gotham, an act which forces the criminals into the arms of a totally amoral psychopath -, The Joker - in an attempt to beat Batman and kill him. The Joker sets the city a moral challenge, which he hopes will turn them on each other. Will they prove their worth or will they cower in the face of anarchy? Meanwhile Rachel, the love of Batman's life, and one of the few who knows his true identity, has fallen for Dent and is put in mortal danger.Christian Bale is a compelling Batman, making the transition from billionaire playboy to caped crusader seamless and utterly believable. Previous actors in the role have been believable as the playboy or the Batman; I'm hard put to think of one who has displayed both personas so well. His Batman is totally self contained, although I found the raspy manner of speaking a little wearing after a while. Forests have already been felled to describe Heath Ledger's Joker, so all I will add is that it's all true, he's terrifying. Maggie Gyllenhaal brings real weight to the role of Rachel Dawes; good to see someone cast in the role of superhero's love interest who is so much more than just a pretty face. Michael Caine (Alfred) is fabulous, Morgan Freeman (Lucius) is reliable, Gary Oldman (Lt. Gordon) just melts into his character- all are excellent. But for me the real revelation was Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent / Two Face. I last saw Eckhart in No Reservations - a movie which is best described as little as possible - and had thought him very nice to look at but light weight as he coasted through it on cruise control; this role stretched him so much further, and I really enjoyed his performance. I thought he was an inspired piece if casting. Altogether a terrific movie, and one I might just have to go and see again, there's so much to it."

Perhaps because I was never a huge fan of the franchise I haven't been as aware of the hype in the way I felt it surrounding the Star Wars Prequels. There has however been something of a slow burn that is now starting to ignite, and it has about it the sense of pomp and solemnity that was first given to the series with Heath Ledgers untimely death, something that now suggests to the world at large that this is more than simple entertainment.I'm going to have to disagree..this is less than simple entertainment. And since first, last and every minute in between I am looking to be entertained by a movie, that raises a problem. The dark knight is a film that takes itself seriously. I don't intrinsically have a problem with that. A lot of movies could learn from that. In this self reflexive self congratulatory age where the endless in-jokes, jobs for your mates and wouldn't -this- be -clever- even- if- it -doesn't- fit- at- all style abounds, film makers who are completely absorbed in the world they are presenting is not a bad thing. We go to escape this world, if they don't believe in their own reality how can we? The problem is this film takes it's STATUS seriously. The film itself, the story, the characters, the tiny details that add up to make us believe and care about what is unfolding before us, to draw us in biting our nails in horror and hope? That kind of got forgotten in the heady glow of epic ideas and mythic imaginings.Batman, the unsung hero, vilified despite giving everything- the idea stirs my soul. the execution...em did they get round to it? Maybe its still on the drawing board. It was a long film a lot of things had to get cut..but maybe the wrong things? The Joker, the anarchic psychotic apocalypse. Bad because he likes it, without reason, without limits, without a plan..well there is a plan- several actually all very neatly playing into each other. Destroy Batman. Bring Gotham to its knees. Take away all hope. And its executed very well for a man who just likes to create chaos and do what he pleases when he pleases. In fact he is so well thought out he has the entire city running in circles unable to stop him and his well trained army..of recently escaped mental patients..Rachel Dawes, the woman Batman loves but cannot be with in case it puts her in danger. The woman who is engaged to the only other man who is standing against the chaos. The woman who is herself standing against the corruption. The woman who despite not dating Batman, is in mortal jeopardy throughout both films.I can go on. The film did. It dragged. Full of strange circular dialogue with big words and epic nonsense that bored me. The humour was taking a nap and I wanted to. Every time I thought it was going to be over, it went off on another random plot line. A film should take you inside as if it were real, make you cower like those first film goers as that train hurtled towards them. This was flat images on a flat screen, big, fancy, long."

The whole world was disappointed however, THE DARK KNIGHT was to remember him by Ledger's amazing last role (and his best one) as the evil clown prince of crime. Anyway, THE DARK KNIGHT is the crown jewel of Nolan's DARK KNIGHT TRILOGY. The cast is brilliant, the writing is brilliant. However, like I said, Heath Ledger is the reason why this film is one of the best films of all time. His role as THE JOKER is outstanding, scary, evil & much more....SPOILERS!!!! --> My favorite 2 scenes in no particular order with Heath Ledger are;1. "WHY SO SERIOUS?" THE JOKER had a bounty on him so when he went to the bounty's owner he hold a knife in his mouth then said the famous word....."WHO SO SERIOUS?"2. "HIT ME!" The only way for JOKER to win is for BATMAN (Christian Bale) to kill him which he tries but fails. Batman was charging at him full speed but quickly turned and fell over. This proves Ledger is the JOKER!The cast is good like Aaron Eckhart (HARVEY DENT), Gary Oldman (GORDON) and Micheal Cane (ALFRED PENNYWORTH) but Ledger is the best.Conclusion: THE DARK KNIGHT is the best superhero film of all times.However, will Jared Leto, who is THE JOKER in SUICIDE SQUAD (2016), be better than Heath Ledger?"

Sign in to vote.,"Batman is My Favorite Hero","I got to see The Dark Knight on Wednesday night, the reason though why I'm writing this movie comment this late is because I didn't wanna just jump and say this movie was awesome, I wanted to think it through, still today, I can't stop thinking about this movie! The Dark Knight lives up to it's hype and goes beyond it, this is the Batman movie that goes where no other Batman movie has gone before. It gave us a real sold story, we are finally told why the villains are the way they are, how all the injustice in the world can get underneath Batman's skin, how you have to believe that people still have faith in good on Earth. Heath Ledger, I absolutely loved Jack Nicolson's performance in the 1989 film, when I first read that Heath was signed onto The Dark Knight, I was like "What are they, kidding?", once you see The Dark Knight... Heath was incredible! I'm not going to compare Jack and Heath's performance, because they were two different versions of the Joker, but Heath's Joker was definitely the more scary and intense of the two nominations. You didn't know what he was going to do next, he was so crazy, he was also so charismatic to the point where you could relate to his character, and the worst part is not only that he's crazy, he's driving Gotham crazy and treating everyone like little puppets on strings that he can control, and guess what, he is doing it so well with a smile on his face.This was so much more than a Batman film, this was so much more than a comic book film, The Dark Knight truly delivers with drama, action, romance, horror, dark humor, the study of a psychopathic killer, a detective story. The force behind this epic movie is Christopher Nolan, who's previous film, Batman Begins, didn't really thrill me, but his incredible film making is truly shown in The Dark Knight, the shots that he got of Gotham City were absolutely fantastic and made you feel part of the city, part of the Batman story. One of the things that I absolutely loved about The Dark Knight is that normally with a comic book movie, you know it's not real, people don't dress up in costumes, and save the day, villains don't name themselves crazy names and dress in make up or crazy costumes, but The Dark Knight actually makes it seem incredibly real, like it could happen.Bruce Wayne is still learning how to be in his double life of Batman and himself, he has lost Rachel to the new district attorney, Harvey Dent, he's inspiring others who are dressing up as Batman and are trying to take on the villains of the city themselves. But things are much worse when the Joker waltzes into town, and he's going to bring Hell upon Gotham City. Constantly playing with Gotham's mind and trying to get Batman to reveal himself, Batman has never dealt with such a psychopathic genius before. The Joker has named himself as the "Classy Villain that Gotham needs", he also has brought a new thought into Batman's head of them actually being more alike than different, that Batman completes him, the Joker would be nothing without him. But Batman is relying on Harvey Dent, who is Gotham's "White Knight" trying to put all of Gotham's scum in jail. But when the Joker plays Batman and Commissioner Gordon, Harvey and Rachel find themselves in very horrific position and Harvey must discover if he will die a hero or live long enough to become a villain.All the performances are dead on in this movie, now everyone's going crazy over Heath Ledger's performance, but one performance I would also love to credit is Aaron Eckhart who plays Harvey Dent/Two Face, his performance was just as great as Heath's and made Two Face a human villain. You could understand his hatred and vengeance on what happened to him and why he became Two Face. I know that everyone is saying this but I truly mean when I say this is one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time. We had some great movies these past few years, but I think The Dark Knight is seriously something special, but I don't wanna build it up too much since some people go to the theater expecting my words to be the same as your own. In my opinion though this is not a great movie, I can't come up with a word describe how incredibly powerful this movie was, to be honest I would go above a 10 rating if I could; this is the Batman film that we have been waiting for. I've seen it twice in one weekend, I'm going to see it three times this upcoming week, I don't mind one bit. I can't wait for the sequel and I would just like to say RIP to Heath, wish he could have seen his breath taking performance as The Joker."

9,3-Aug-08,StanleyKubrick2001,4,10,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"The not so dark knight.","After all the hype and anticipation surrounding this movie i finally went and saw it last night. I really enjoyed parts of the movie, and the script was very well written. The performance from Heath Ledger was brilliant and made the movie for me. Bale and Eckhart's acting fall short in comparison. If you look at The dark knight as a pure action movie it's the best of its genre, hands down. But when people start comparing it to the greatest movies in cinematic history i don't follow. I don't get why everyone is calling so very dark? it's no darker then the last batman movie in any sense. It would have been dark if the people on the boats killed each other in the end, but that would have been morally wrong. The dark knight has surpassed The godfather trilogy and several other greats like Shindlers list and Casablanca on the IMDb rating system by a mile. Doesn't this seem very odd to anyone else? It seems like I'm the only one (or one of a few) to criticize this seemingly wonderful masterpiece. The short answer to why this movie is so successful is because of the amens advertising campaigns and hysterical hype, also the tragic death of Heath Ledger. One could of course debate and argue other reasons, but to me its a top-notch action movie with a great storyline and no more, and that's very far from even being a contender for the greatest movie in cinematic history."

Sign in to vote.,"Smashing follow-up to Batman Begins.","I really like the first one in this current series, 'Batman Begins', because it takes us from Bruce Wayne's young years and then through his mystical training, and his beginnings to fight crime in Gotham City. This second installment is better in many ways, but for me doesn't quite have the charm of the first.Christian Bale of course is back as Bruce Wayne and Batman. But his childhood sweetheart and now District Attorney lawyer is Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel Dawes. She does a fine job but is a definite step down from Katie Holmes.Most of the buzz has been, especially after his untimely death, Heath Ledger as The Joker. This Joker is quite different from the character Jack Nicholson played in the 1989 version, more sinister and more dangerous. He doesn't have any grand plan, he just enjoys wreaking havoc, and his mission here is to kill innocent people and cause destruction until he succeeds in having Batman's identity revealed. Ledger is chillingly good in this role.Aaron Eckhart is introduced as Harvey Dent who, after getting caught up in an explosion, becomes Two-Face. Michael Caine is back as Bruce Wayne's butler and father figure, Alfred Pennyworth, and plays the role just perfectly. As well as Gary Oldman, back as cop James Gordon. And Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, now head of the Wayne corporation and Bruce's personal scientific consultant.The new crime boss is Eric Roberts as Salvatore Maroni, and he is superb in the role. I have always been a fan of Roberts' and it is good to see him in a feature role as this.Overall a fine movie, both as a drama and as an action movie."

But the real star was no doubt heath ledger(R.I.P) as the joker he stole that role sorry jack nicholson but his a way better joker than you were the action was great especially the car chase scene where batman flips the truck. Not to forget the make up of two face is way better and realistic as compared to the one given to two face (tommy lee jones) in batman forever.simply the movie had every thing other batman don't have a geat hero a better villain and a way more realistic and serious story line.GreAt job Christopher Nolan keep it up cant wait for the next batman.9/10 is a fair rating. could have been 10/10 but i was just disappointed with the short scene given to two face he deserve to have his own batman movie as the main villain. all in all i recommended it all those fans of super hero movie go see it now!!!!!"

9,31-Jan-14,The_Film_Cricket,0,1,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"The Dark Heart of The Dark Knight","Batman is no longer just a superhero. He's a study in damaged psychology. So too are his rogue's gallery of villains. Part of what prepared me for The Dark Knight was the work that the Nolan brothers began in their previous film Batman Begins, which threw away the laser light show of the earlier films and got down to the business of exploring how and why Bruce Wayne created this bat persona in the first place. That movie explored his motivation in a logical sense by returning Batman to the film noir world from which the character has his origins. The beauty of The Dark Knight is that, having already explored the origins of the Batman character, Nolan can now build a story that is free of heavy introductory elements.Having explored Batman's personality in the previous film, The Dark Knight, for the most part, moves Batman just left of center so that the story can focus on the psychology of his chief adversary. This portrait of The Joker is more or less grounded in reality. Unlike previous incarnations of the character, in which he is an established fixture in Gotham City, this Joker seems to have no past. The film throws away the conventional approach to The Joker and attempts a new approach. We usually see him as a harlequin in clown makeup who has his own private mob of clown-faced goons and a bag of incendiary tricks. In The Dark Knight, those elements are gone. The Joker drops into Gotham City seemingly out of nowhere. No one in Gotham City has any idea who this man is, and when the story is over we know next to nothing about him. What passes for a back-story is a running gag in which he threatens his victims with a knife while regaling various versions of the story about how he got the scars on his cheeks. Whether or not any of these stories are true hardly matters. We never find out anything about his background. We don't know why he wears makeup or why he commits atrocities. What we come to understand about these things is born from a bizarre pseudo-philosophy that has less to do with truth than from the fact that, for the most part, he's just yanking our chain.Like Hannibal Lecter, this Joker's effectiveness lies in how little we know about him. He has no bag of tricks, he hides his face behind a ghastly smear of white, black and red makeup. He speaks with an unnerving Bugs Bunny voice and informs us that "The only sensible way to live in this world is without rules". He is an anarchist. He doesn't want money, or power, or even media attention. He wants to blow stuff up - real good. As the police and the mob figures in Gotham City try to figure out this menace, Bruce Wayne's butler Alfred (Michael Caine) offers a brilliant theory: "Some men aren't looking for anything logical, like money. They can't be bought, bullied, reasoned or negotiated with. Some men just want to watch the world burn." That line stays in our minds and what we come to learn is that The Joker's motivation is bred from the fact that he is excited to toy with Batman, whom he considers an equal. He creates a battle of good and evil with his arch nemesis because he sees the Caped Crusader as a worthy opponent. When the bat asks "Why are you trying to kill me?" the clown can't believe his ears "I'm not trying to kill you. What would I do without you? You complete me!" That has been the point of the battle between Batman and The Joker from the very beginning.That is the film's great story arc but there is another thread brewing that is just as substantial. Commissioner James Gordon (Gary Oldman), working secretly with Batman but keeping it under wraps, helps the dark knight round up the key figures in the local mob, including an accountant that he must travel all the way to Hong Kong to retrieve. Gordon doesn't know this vigilante's identity and keeps their affiliation under wraps. He's getting the job done, so why complain? This secret alliance helps the public image of District Attorney Harvey Dent who publicly makes a stand against Gotham City's mobsters.Dent's role in the story creates a much deeper exploration of what corrupts a man's soul. Dent is a do-gooder, a man who stands for truth and justice without ever really understanding what he is up against. When the invisible alliance between he and Gordon and Batman pin the mob to the wall, it opens the door for The Joker to begin his reign of terror. No one really understands The Joker or his motives. He is a loose cannon. He is unpredictable and when one of his bombs takes out Dent's fiancé, Dent himself has his own soul corrupted, he becomes embittered by his love's death and by his own disfigurement which seems to represent the emerging of his own dark nature. Literally two-faced.These complexities have always been at the heart of Batman both on the page and on the screen. The Batman villains have always had a deeper level, and there has always been a method to their madness. The Dark Knight is the first film the truly examines that madness. It presents both The Joker and Two-Face, not as cartoon villains but as men with deep emotional scars. The Joker is an enigma, operating within a pattern of anarchy that no one can understand nor predict. Two-Face is presented as a tragic hero, a very good man who gets into a situation that brings his darker nature to the surface. In effect, this returns the Batman saga to its film noir roots. The story is dark, its characters have deep emotional complexities and The Dark Knight explores that is a way no film ever has."

9,19-Jul-11,mnpollio,0,1,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"Spectacular sequel , although the fun has left the building","Director Christopher Nolan defies the odds and crafts a sequel that surpasses the original. In short, this becomes The Godfather-Part II of comic book movies and establishes a new parameter that others that follow will be judged - perhaps a bit too harshly.Gotham City's march toward the light is bolstered by the efforts of nighttime vigilante hero Batman and by idealistic crusading district attorney Harvey Dent, but their efforts are undermined by the appearance of a brilliant anarchist known only as the Joker, whose diabolical attacks have a tendency to expose the seamy underside of many of Gotham's citizens.The film unfolds like a labyrinthine crime epic, with a multitude of supporting players and wide-ranging locales. This offers a dynamic landscape and an unpredictable quality to the production that is riveting. Nolan's direction is expert.Once again, he demonstrates a fine feel for character development and how to have action spring naturally from the proceedings rather than feeling inserted. The film is incredibly exciting in some stretches and never less than thought-provoking in others.Christian Bale returns triumphantly as Batman/Bruce Wayne. He still creates an appealing, multi-layered hero, but the real dominant element this time around is the story. Michael Caine, Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman are all back and in top form. Oldman, especially, continues to find new terrain in a character all but reduced to nothingness in earlier incarnations.The film gets a lot of mileage out of two new additions. It took some real chutzpah to use the Joker in this film - a role which was virtually owned by Jack Nicholson in 1989s Batman. When word came that Heath Ledger was cast in the part, jaws dropped at the lunacy. Amazingly, it became the performance of the year and left people wondering Jack Who? Ledger's approach to the Joker is almost a polar opposite to Nicholson and it not only works - but succeeds gangbusters. We learn almost nothing about this character and Nolan uses him only as much as he needs to, but every moment he steps on screen it becomes impossible to tear your eyes away. Ledger crafts a character of maniacal brilliance. This is truly a chilling character for the ages and the posthumous Oscar was more than deserved.By contrast, Aaron Eckhart gets far less credit for his turn, but he also creates a compelling character in the upright, yet morally flawed Harvey Dent - destined by tragedy and chance to become the unbalanced Two-Face. The film sets up his character as the emotional soul of the new Gotham and then puts him through the ringer. Eckhart is appealing and charismatic as the righteous Dent hinting at shades of gray beneath the surface. Later, he cuts a dramatic and sympathetic figure as the broken former hero of the people whose spirit and psyche become casualties of the Joker's manipulations. A further thumbs up to the convincing make-up for Eckhart's late film transformation as well, which is far more amazing than anything handed to Tommy Lee Jones in Batman Forever.What prevents me from rating the film as a perfect 10 are two quibbles. One minor and one not so minor.Once again, the character of Rachel Dawes is a stumbling block here. The critically drubbed Katie Holmes from the original has been replaced by Maggie Gyllenhaal. Although I found Holmes lacking, I will chance being in the minority here when I say Gyllenhaal is not an improvement. The character remains a wet blanket, but this time she gets an entire subplot - a romantic triangle with both Bale and Eckhart. Like Holmes, Gyllenhaal is not remotely convincing as an attorney and shares no chemistry with Bale (nor Eckhart). However, Holmes at least brought some sex appeal to the part - Gyllenhaal by comparison seems downright pallid and often uncomfortable. She gives us no good reason why the two most eligible bachelors in Gotham City would be even minimally interested in her - much less entranced. When she keeps going back and forth between the two men, she brings all of the emotional heft of a woman deciding her grocery list. As such, the romantic subplot is a washout and lacks the emotional punch needed in the later moments.Some of the late plot twists are a bit overly manipulative. The film's insistence to turn Batman through circumstance and by his own martyrdom into a tragic pariah in the final scenes smacks of needless melodrama. The characters and film's insistence that Gotham City could not stand to know the truth about the deterioration of Harvey Dent seems a manufactured philosophical crisis that comes out of left field. Truthfully, the citizens of Gotham are oddly fickle and cynical, and we have only the pontificating of the heroes rather than anything concrete that we have seen that forces the final conclusions drawn by those on screen. So while the ending has a certain power, there are far too many mental and emotional jumps required by the players to realize it, and even then it is not 100 percent convincing.Yet I feel that the film's biggest flaw is that one would think no matter how serious the proceedings, a film based on a comic book should have some elements of fun. As amazing as all of Nolan's accomplishments are, this film is not a fun watch by any stretch - it is dark, despairing, emotionally wrenching, often nasty, unpredictable and ingenious. However, the fun element is completely A.W.O.L. As such, while I stand in awe of its successes, I could easily go 10 years without wanting to sit through it again, which I am pretty certain is not the hallmark of a perfect film."

More importantly, it forebodes the following sequence when the Joker is arrested and jailed in a fortress that's "not sealed." I digress, while Heath Ledger is everything everyone and their mother has written about him this is really Aaron Eckhart's movie. His Harvey Dent is the center of the gathering storm... the object of the Joker & Batman's duel is for Dent's soul... and in turn that of Gotham City. Director Nolan sets up the end nicely for the follow-up film, but better over-all editing would have gotten us (the audience) there sooner. This film is too long. For it's genre (action/adventure) it's brilliant, those action sequences blow us away, but Nolan should have trimmed some story fat. I have two quibbles: what was that cameo w/ Scarecrow all about? Couldn't the Nolan brothers have written a scene to remove him from the film that involved the Joker? Also, as a minority Nolan relegates the few minorities to baddies (Det. Ramirez, the Asian accountant) to token cameos (the Mayor)."

9,21-Aug-12,Errington_92,0,4,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"Batman Rightly Is The Dark Knight","Immensely entertaining and thought provoking The Dark Knight doesn't come across as the typical blockbuster. Beyond the combat scenes and extensive action sequences The Dark Knight explores deeply the themes of morality and corruption via the actions of the characters which I found greatly intriguing.At the core of the narrative is the conflict between Batman and the Joker in which they trade blows and mind games go amuck. The conflict is mostly intensified by the brilliant performance given by Heath Leger whose demeanour is one of cool indifference of his actions and the flamboyantly creepy tone in his voice, his persona horrifies as much as it fascinates. Yet despite his disturbed personality he rightly highlights the status of Batman as an outsider. "To them you're just a freak like me", resulting in violent outburst from Batman which is connected to his inner vulnerability in terms of his feelings regarding his own persona.Bruce Wanye's persona as Batman not only raises questions from himself about how far he goes but also makes others question his actions. Some begin to blame Batman for the troubles in Gotham throughout The Dark Knight seeing him as selfish and a vigilante. It is a recurring element which makes the audience question Batman's methods, is he truly a hero or a man who follows his own rules no matter the cost? Yet The Dark Knight turns this question upon ourselves when citizens and convicts are given the choice to kill the other to save themselves. Surely we were all thinking thoughts others may deem to be selfish. Therefore was Batman as selfish as anyone else in Gotham? The Dark Knight achieves intellectual satisfaction in making us ponder such elements.This theme continues as it intertwines with corruption taken on by Commissioner Gordon and Harvey Dent. Both are honourable men in a corrupt city going to great lengths to fight organised crime. However it comes at a price with Harvey Dent becoming Two Face in the process of playing a part of the indecent world he wished to destroy and Gordon having to reluctantly betray his morals to mislead Gotham into a lie. The Dark Knight again confronts us with the morality within ones actions as if to comment that the world is not completely black and white.Although these themes play a major role in The Dark Knight it also has room for lighter elements such as romance, where Wayne and Dent aim for the affections of Rachel in scenes providing nothing more than a brief relief from the seriousness of The Dark Knight's main theme. The combat sequences are choreographed well and convey realism within each movement which enables such sequences to be more fulfilling for the audience as it draws us in rather than being amused by a staged quality which sometimes plagues other films of similar stature or even previous Batman films, with Tim Burton's installments coming to mind. The cinematography and editing are also vital in drawing the audience in with its fast cutting and pace enthralling us particularly in the opening sequences where the Joker's robbery and Batman's latest intervention are juxapostioned getting the audience ready for what lied ahead.It may have been a blockbuster in 2008 but The Dark Knight conjures much more than intense combat and large explosions. It leaves an afterthought of the consequences of being a hero as Batman/Bruce Wayne is a conflicted individual whose sense of humanity ironically sets his fall from grace by the closing moments setting the stage for the fallout in the equally provoking sequel The Dark Knight Rises. It gives The Dark Knight a human quality to its heroic protagonist which can be missing from other superhero films."

His irritatingly raspy voice and weak characterization (from an otherwise solid actor) would have weighted a lot more of the movie down had Nolan not been mor...(read more) e interested in other (stronger) characters like The Joker and Harvey Dent. Ledger's Joker is more of a wounded, feral creature than a human, absently licking his lips and limping away from the chaos he creates. And Dent (played affably but not to perfection by Eckhart) is more his opposite than Batman.Ambitious would be an understatement, and that's part of the problem. There are a lot of interesting ideas at work, but few come to fruition. The film opens with Batman impersonators, which at a glance would fit in with the main arc of Batman's influence on the city. Yet, once introduced, they're hardly brought up again. Batman has this absurd sonar gadget that essentially stands in for U.S. government wiretapping (he can spy on every Gothamite through their cell phones), something that Lucius Fox disapproves of. It is mentioned and used once, then disposed of in a pretty silly way.Nolan, however, has improved on his previous installment in a lot of ways. Gotham feels more like a real city - one even existing in a post 9/11 world, nonetheless. And despite it's length (which could have easily lost about 20 minutes), The Dark Knight never gets boring. Although, much like with Batman Begins, Nolan couldn't put a decent action scene together at gunpoint.It's an ensemble piece, and a very good one at that. But it's far from the brilliant epic it clearly aspires to be."

Was that a harsh thing to say? Yes, well it's a fact. Let me explain. Note, I saw this movie 7 times in theaters and countless times on Blu Ray.1.) It's suspenseful. From the very beginning of this movie, I was sucked in, the bank heist in the beginning was by far the best opening I have ever seen for a movie. Not to mention the tension that was being build up because of the chaos that the joker made. Man was that a great interpretation of the Joker. 2.) The acting was perfect. There was not ONE bad performance. I can't think of one, yes, the obvious example was Heath Ledger's performance as The Joker. But, not many mention the performance by Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent or Christian Bale's impeccable Batman performance. Neither Val Kilmer, Michael Keaton, Adam West or George Clooney has played a performance like Bale did.3.) The editing/ Camera work. All are perfect, the editing, music and camera work just brought on the intensity of the movie. A true film lover will simply admire The Dark Knight for that. Can you tell me how it can be better? No, you cannot because it's a perfect movie.The Dark Knight is the best movie I have ever seen, that and The Matrix are neck-to-neck my favorite movies. Both are perfect film. I never call a movie flawless but, The Dark Knight, has no flaws. Now, I know the readers will not find this review useful because of how bias it was but I do not care, I wanted to say my thoughts on this film. I can't believe it took me this long to write this review."

It's a crime drama with interesting action scenes thrown in.However, the movie wouldn't have worked if it wasn't a terrific superhero movie. The best aspect of this movie is the complicated plot that revolves around the Joker. We keep on guessing what his ultimate plan is, what he's going to do next, how will Batman and friends deal with him? It has so many stories interwoven that it will keep your mind occupied up to the very end.It is especially interesting in it's handling of the love triangle."

It has fantastic visuals, lots of action, powerful acting, detailed characters, a strong cast, and knives. Lots and lots of knives. Allow me to break things down and go into further details.To begin, this is Christopher Nolan (known for The Prestige) everybody. He's become one of the most recognized faces in cinema. He's a fantastic and dexterous director. His skill in the field has expanded the movie industry in numbers I can't describe. From my perspective, Christopher Nolan is inches away from becoming the next Stanley Kubrick - with all the visuals, enhanced camera work etc., he's a pioneer. And his work in this film is superb. I kept begging for more. I felt like a baby and he had been nurturing me with the sweet goodness of his cinematic genius. I'm going to need to find more adjectives to describe this guy.What about Batman? The Dark Knight? The Caped Crusader? Bruce Wayne? Well, the actor Christian Bale (also known for The Prestige) did a fantastic job portraying this role. Yes, they could've done a better job with the whole scratchy disguise voice but, once you get past that you see how wonderful this actor can be.Of course, it's The Joker who stole the show. Heath Ledger (known for Brokeback Mountain) got a well deserved Academy Award for this film, but I really wish he had been alive to get it. I really wanted to see more from this guy. As an actor, he's been getting a lot of B.S., especially for Brokeback Mountain. That was a very good movie and it doesn't deserve any of the hate it gets. The point is, Heath Ledger did what I thought no man could ever do and that is be more crazy than Jack Nicholson (known for Batman). I had originally thought of ol' Jack to be the best Joker but in 2008 I realized how wrong I was. This movie owes everything to Heath. This movie, in turn, has made him both one of my favorite actors and characters. The character alone is brilliant. The way he uses practical jokes as weapons is both scary and fun. I could talk about this character for hours upon hours but, this review must continue.The suspense an action are great. The way they bring the supporting cast into it is fantastic. My favorite scene is when Bruce Wayne has to choose who to save from the Joker's trap: Harvey Dent and Rachel. He saves Dent because he doesn't want his personal feelings to get in the way or else it will cause suspicion about the connection Bruce had with Rachel but, this left Dent scarred for the rest of his life. This led the Joker into transforming Dent psychologically into another criminal.Everybody should check this movie out. It's got a great story, excellent cast and is quite frankly --- flawless. I'm running out of words to describe this film. Just watch it, my rating is obviously a 10/10."

Batman Begins was a great movie that I enjoyed immensely but The Dark Knight blows that one out of the water and obliterates any other comic book movie ever made period.Let's go right to what everyone has been talking about. I have never seen another performance like that of Heath Ledger's. He inhabited the character of The Joker to the point that he is unrecognizable as anything but. He became The Joker. I don't feel it was Heath Ledger playing The Joker as much as it was The Joker playing himself. I left the theatre bloody well speechless. Nothing against Nicholson's Joker but Ledger's Joker is so far superiorThis isn't hype...It's just the best"

They did so much right in this franchise, but the biggest thing for me is the inspiration this film exudes and that's what I feel films should always have a message of, hope and inspiration. Batman has to overcome so many insurmountable odds and when he does you feel like you can go out and win too. When I think about it, my top movies that I love all have an element of this; The Lord of the Rings, Shawshank Redemption, Rocky, Alien, the list goes on. Films should always look to do this beyond just being entertaining, in my humble opinion."

Sign in to vote.,"The Elephant In The Room","My review contains some spoilers.Maybe everyone is afraid to say it, but there's an elephant in the room and it's that this movie was NOT as good as expected and certainly not as good as the hype implied. I'm compelled to call a spade a spade.Most movies (whether good or bad) know enough to have a beginning middle and end. This movie was ALL MIDDLE. It was a series of scenes strung together with no pacing to allude to how the overall time was passing, with no feeling of buildup and no distinction between what should be acts that define where you might be in the story line. I guarantee I'm not the only one out there who kept looking at my watch starting around the 1-hour mark and hoping the pace would be improved.I want to say good things. Heath Ledger's performance was good. The anti-moral undertones were ballsy for a mass-market movie. The 2-face special effects were handled perfectly. And I was a comic fan as a kid and any comic book movie, especially a batman one, deserves credit by default.Now the bad. One of the things that made the first movie great was the attempt to ground it totally in reality. Barely any suspension of disbelief was needed for "Batman Begins". But in this - sonar cell phones? Uh, what? In short time turning every cell phone in Gotham into a sonar real-time 3D tracking system for the entire city with real-time 3D visuals all being fed into some location, somewhere...? What? And then the glowing goggles that somehow received the signal... What? Was this an attempt to use a farcical James Bond jump-the-shark plot device to make the writing a lot easier near the end? Where's the back-story for The Joker? He's just some loony? What's his motivation? OK he burns a pile of money. How does he get anything done without money? Do all his hired guns work for free? The ones that it takes to move hundreds of barrels of explosive fuel into all kinds of locations throughout the movie. 2 warehouses, 2 boats, a hospital...The costume modification mid-way was weak and made batman LOOK weak. The actress change, then killing her anyway. Why not just create a different character for the love interest? The joker was EVERYWHERE at all times, like an omniscient god. Give me a break. Nothing was played out as plausible. Maggie Gyllenhaal is NOT ATTRACTIVE (at least not for the character she's supposed to be playing). Bale's voice while as Batman was too forced and was over-the-top. The story drags and drags. No mansion? A penthouse in a city that looks nothing like Gotham is supposed to look. It was a shiny upscale city that looked more like upscale Manhattan. I could go on, but basically there were another 50 times like that in the movie where, rather than helping me immerse into the story, it made me go "huh?""

This is the last movie that Heath Ledger filmed completely and I believe some how he saved the best for last as he managed to put an outstanding final act of a realistic Joker and managed to put a smile on our faces before death brings down the curtains on his talent."

Sign in to vote.,""The Dark Knight" finally realizes the full potential of the Batman mythology","Cards (hardy har har) on the table: Going into "The Dark Knight" in IMAX I did not think Christopher Nolan was a great director, I was not too taken by "Batman Begins" (although it was refreshing after Burton and Schumacher reminded me of the lesser Batman comics I have read, and, bizarrely for non-comedies, of the 60's television series and the film version of that, except less fun), I did not think Heath Ledger was among the great actors of his generation, I did not think Christian Bale was the best actor alive, and I was not expecting anything more than an entertaining Batman movie, despite being reassured by everyone I trust about movies that it was much more.Having seen it, as intended with the scenes filmed specifically for IMAX intact and covering the entire IMAX screen vertically, I can safely say that "The Dark Knight" is without question the first time the Batman character and the many great comics based in Gotham City have been done justice on film. Nolan's version of Batman is not meant to be realistic, it is meant to be plausible, and everything here including Two-Face feels plausible. Still, the film has not forsaken its comic book roots. This is not the watered-down Batman of the 50's, this is the Batman conceived in the 30's and re-born in the 80's. Moments here, thanks to Ledger's astonishingly creepy and believable performance as the Joker (this is the original Joker. Bank robber with no motive, mass-murderer with not a hint of mercy, not the ludicrous clown Jack Nicholson horribly portrayed in Burton's 1989 effort), recall the great Batman book "Arkham Asylum". Others recall "The Killing Joke". As anyone who has read those books will testify, that is just about the highest praise I can give the portrayal of the Joker here.I do think that seeing this in IMAX enhances the experience, although it is a little annoying when the picture clarity goes from as clear as possible to clearly blown-up when the scene switches from those shot on IMAX cameras to those shot on regular film. One can really appreciate the sound design here as well, which is absolutely remarkable all the way through.This is, as far as I'm concerned, easily Nolan's best work as director. His handling of the film's pacing is absolutely stunning, and the action here is both filmed and edited much better than in "Begins". It is Nolan's work with actors that particularly impresses, with just about every moment of acting being superb here. Of course, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are phoning it in but they don't exactly need to be brilliant here. Bale, as well, displays little depth as Wayne, but embodies all his charm and makes for an excellent Batman (unless your perception of Batman is a wisecracking fool, then you might be disappointed). No, the acting I refer to here is the extraordinary performances by Ledger, Oldman, and Eckhart. Although Ledger will surely get all the attention (and he's certainly great here), I think that both Oldman and Eckhart stole the show a bit. Eckhart is better as Dent than Two-Face but the transformation is certainly not an easy task for any actor. Maggie Gyllenhaal is unquestionably better as Rachel Dawes than Katie Holmes was, and Nestor Carbonell, not an actor with much range, is really very good as the Mayor of Gotham City.Over and over again film versions of Batman have disappointed. Has "The Dark Knight" finally got it right? No doubt some will moan and complain about it not being distinctive or stylized enough, not capturing the spirit of the comics. Guess what? You have been reading the WRONG comics. The best Batman comics may not always strive for plausibility, but they are certainly far from the 'silly fun' some might expect from "The Dark Knight". What you will get here is a tense, dramatic crime thriller with some breathtaking action set-pieces, remarkable characterization. The Joker being given such a complex psychological profile is a stunning achievement, and Ledger is terrifying in the role. You really believe that he is dangerous and his sick social experiments are nerve-wracking to witness.I have one or two misgivings about "The Dark Knight". I don't know if I would have handled Rachel Dawes and Harvey Dent/Two-Face the way the Nolan brothers do in this screenplay, but virtually the rest of the film is pitch-perfect. The pace is astonishing (I could hardly believe the film was as long as it actually was), the acting is phenomenal, the visual look of the film is right, especially given the subtext Nolan is going for here (which you'll see when you've seen the film), the characters are rich, the drama is real, the action is spectacular, and finally- The Joker is given a definitive portrayal.Tim Burton once said, "Anyone who knows me knows I would never read a comic book". For shame, Mr. Burton. Maybe if you had you could have made something this good. "The Dark Knight" does the character of Batman justice, it does The Joker justice, and it does the great Batman comics justice. In two and a half hours "The Dark Knight" makes up for all the silly, offensive garbage adapted from comic books and graphic novels, and reveals just how much can be done with the characters and ideas in those books. This is finally a film that does justice to the Batman universe."

9,22-Jul-08,tedg,19,38,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"The Noir Card","Two things interesting about this for me. (I'll let others talk about Heath.)One is how much more of a comic book it is than a film. I don't mean that it is sillier or more fantastic, but that the values seem to be based on storyboards as panels. The implications are pretty interesting. All those Marvel productions are pretty much the same: the same level of fantasy, the same vocabulary of cinematic effects. The same slant from "graphic novel" framing to modern film traditions  which incidentally are less designed than are the accidents of common CGI compositing tools.This on the other hand is not cinematic. It makes it boring for me visually, but there's another result: the story. The story is not your standard long form arc. Its at least four stories concatenated, as if you would read a few pages and come back at the next lunch break. It rambles, it has real comicbook soap opera. I really do think of this as a comic book that accidentally finds itself in a film. That's as opposed to "Sin City," which though based on a comic, and supposedly co- directed by the comic artist, is intensely cinematic, so much so you almost drown.The other feature for me: the handling of noir.Noir is all about how the viewer manipulates the action by viewing. It has permeated nearly every corner of film and most intelligent filmmakers try to play with it. It is the primary narrative tool we have to add depth by adding layers. The Nolans are intelligent filmmakers. While the film isn't very cinematic, the script is, in this regard. The novel trick here is the joker. Sure he is played well, and Ledger was becoming one of our foremost folded actors. But the thing works because the role was written to matter, and that's because he introduces a double noir fold. The watcher is in the film, and the watcher is "writing" the script regardless of any action that anyone in the film can take. Its classic noir doubled. The joker's key speeches even cover all the noir highlights: you have to ruin routine; you have to profoundly affect, even kill random innocents; you have to express an amazingly complex orchestration and make it seem capricious, accidental. You have to deny intent and complexity. You have to pretend to not be amused.All these things are embodied in what Ledger was given. This is very important writing, and if you know "Prestige" and "Memento," even "Following," you would have expected something like this. Even if the film isn't good as a film, the writing is, and that allows Heath to make a film within. Its why "Clockwork Orange" is so important.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

You must be kidding me. Ledger does not deserve an Oscar nomination for this. If anything, Jack Nicholson does a far better job playing the Joker. Christian Bale basically mumbles through most of his Bat man parts, and isn't much better when he isn't. Plot is stupid as heck. They make the Joker sound like some super human beast from another world. A dozen officers with machine guns would of killed him off in 2 seconds. But i guess that would of ruined the story line.

9,23-Dec-08,Michael_Elliott,13,30,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"Great Film","Dark Knight, The (2008) **** (out of 4) I'll be honest and admit that I'm not much of a fan of the so called "comic book" movies out there. I'll also be honest and admit that I didn't care for the previous series of Batman movies from Burton and Schumacher. Batman Begins on the other hand was a different story as it found it to be incredibly good but a rare occasion as occurred as this sequel is even better. I've always felt that comic book movies didn't contain enough elements of a dark nature nor did they contain very much adult-themed stuff but that's certainly not the case here as this movie contains enough character development and moral questions for three movies. The epic nature of this movie makes it a one of a kind even though I think the 151-minute running time is the only fault in the film. It's rather amazing at how dark this movie is yet movie crowds ate it up but perhaps they ate so much of it up simply because of how dark it is. This film works on so many levels but I think the biggest are its screenplay and actors. The darkness of the story is perfectly brought to the screen by Nolan with his masterful direction, which paints the perfect picture of corruption, greed and moral responsibility. All of the characters from The Joker to Harvey Dent to even Batman must face various moral issues and this type of stuff not only makes for great drama but it brings a lot of depth to this "comic book" movie. The performances are all quite remarkable and that includes the late Heath Ledger as The Joker. Before seeing the film I kept asking myself if his performance could top that of Jack Nicholson but I think that question shouldn't even be asked as both performances are so completely different that you can't compare them. Ledger certainly steals the show and leaves the viewer with goose bumps each time he's on the screen. It really seems as if he just floats through each scene as if he were a ghost roaming around. The walk that Ledger brings to the character is so refreshing and original that I couldn't take my eyes off of him. That wonderful talk and the brilliant line giving just adds to the fun and was it ever great to see such a dark villain. Christian Bale is also once again very good in the role of Bruce Wayne and Batman. Again, the screenplay benefits Bale greatly by having him just as dark as the villains. Aaron Eckhart is getting overshadowed by Ledger but he too really deserves a lot of credit as he probably gives the best performance of anyone dealing with the moral issues. His stint as Dent is perfect for a hero and his turn as Two-Face is perfect for a villain. Maggie Gyllenhaal also does a good job in the love interests role as does Michael Caine, Eric Roberts and Morgan Freeman. Gary Oldman also shines in his role of Gordon. What makes the special effects so great is that the movie isn't in their hand as far as entertainment goes. Yes, the effects and chase sequences look great but they work even better because the screenplay gives us characters to care about. I won't go as far as to call this one of the greatest films ever made but I do think it has to change the way comic book movies are made."

I don't think even the 1989 Batman got as much publicity. Too much pre-hype can really hurt a film, I give Snakes On A Plane as an example. I saw it today and wanted to set down my observations. Yes it is a good film with a lot of action. I grew up watching the Adam West Batman, light hearted and campy. The title of this movie is accurate, they do make him as a dark night who has almost as much inner torments and demons as the villains he pursues! He has just not let the darkness overwhelm him. Like everyone else, I was saddened by Heath Ledger's tragic death and I think that might be one of the reasons for the raves about his performance, people see it with their hearts instead of their heads. The truth of the matter is that yes he does give a good turn as the Joker. He brought his considerable talent to the role and truly made it his own. However, he did not for one moment make me forget Jack Nicholson! That was one part Jack was born to play and Ledger was real gutsy to even try, but he didn't come close. Ledger was good but there is only one Jack Nicholson and he is the best. Sorry Heath, have fun in Heaven though."

The bombings are highly contrived and would have been more credible if the film was going for a cheeky jokey style but it tries to be serious and doesn't have any logic to it.I really can't believe the rave reviews this movie got, it's at best a three out of ten. I had no expectations but still came out feeling let down. I had to watch the original movie afterwards which has a plot, interesting characters and a Batman that doesn't sound ridiculous every time he opens his mouth. A crap effort all round, but people are loving it which explains why Hollywood puts zero effort into most movies and lots of effort into advertising.It's not even visually interesting except for the odd shot where it looks quite gritty.

Three years later, the British director - who also co-wrote and co-produced - is back with an even darker and even more impressive outing for Bob Kane's caped crusader, the first not to include 'Batman' in the title.Like any top-notch action movie should, it opens immediately with a fast-paced and violent sequence that is well-shot and well-executed and the excitement and exhilaration never let up for a lengthy 152 minutes. It's not always clear what is been said and the plotting is sometimes confusing too, but the sheer fury and verve of the thing carries you through and gives you a real adrenaline rush.All the usual Batman elements are there: the man himself, played again with cool skill by Christian Bale; his English butler (Michael Caine) and Q-like support (Morgan Freeman); the soon to be Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman); the love interest Rachel Dawes (with Katie Holmes out of the picture, portrayed this time by Maggie Gyllenhaal); an array of ugly bad guys and one who starts off as both good-looking and ultra-good (Aaron Eckhart as Harvey 'Two Face' Dent); the soaring and brooding city of Gotham (actually Chicago); of course, the technology, including a new sleek Batmobile and an amazing bike-like Batpod; plus the insistent soundtrack of Hans Zimmer.What's different is the performance of the character intending to be Batman's nemesis and the political message permeating this post 9/11 thriller.The late Heath Ledger gives a chillingly brilliant portrayal of The Joker that is miles apart from the earlier outing by Jack Nicholson. This is a villain who cannot be bought and with whom one cannot negotiate because he is not in the game for any material or political objective but simply to cause utter mayhem. A kind of Osama bin Laden character then, except The Joker is even crazier in setting up life and death choices for people that have no purpose but cruelty and chaos.Time and time again, men in the movie are faced with the dilemmas facing democracies today: should personal liberties be sacrificed to make it more likely that one will prevent an attack on one of our cities with an inevitable loss of innocent lives? should we torture someone evil if we believe that the resulting information will save lives of the good? At times, even Batman behaves like Bush or Bauer in a morally ambiguous representation of power."

Sign in to vote.,"For the first time, two and a half hours feels so short!","This is about Batman trying to stop the Joker from taking over Gotham City."The Dark Knight" is truly amazing. For the first time, I wanted a two and a half hour film to be longer. It's that good! The story telling is very good. Every scene is captivating, shocking and mesmerising. It kept me interested throughout the film, and in fact most of the time my hands were sweaty from all the excitement and suspense.It's amazing that it does not require tight editing, excessive gore or senseless violence to make the film exciting. Christopher Nolan really knows how to tell a story and transform it into a masterpiece that is not only entertaining, but also thrilling and memorable at the same time. No wonder Christian Bale would only star in the next Batman film only if Nolan is the director!"

9,19-Dec-09,imdbbl,5,9,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"Run-of-the-mill superhero movie with big pretensions","Batman raises the stakes in his bourgeois war on crime. With the help of Lieutenant Jim Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent, Batman sets out to dismantle the remaining criminal organizations that plague the city streets. The partnership proves to be effective, but they soon find themselves prey to a reign of chaos unleashed by a rising criminal mastermind known to the terrified citizens of Gotham as The Joker... The Dark Knight is nothing more then an average super hero movie. I find it to be completely overrated and I couldn't disagree more with those who consider this to be worthy of the top250 IMDb list. First of all, after a while, the story gets boring and dull because there's too much politics and bureaucracy involved, and it's not that I don't enjoy a rich plot, it's just that it all seems very contrived and pointless and it drags out way too long. They injected a lot of philosophical questions and moral dilemmas in an attempt to diverge a little from the usual cut and dry, straight-forward superhero movie but, they should've sticked to what the genre usually offers, entertainment and action, because the end product is a very uneven piece of work. The actions scenes were disappointing mainly because of the editing and successive cuts that make it hard to really see what's going on, this happens particularly in the fighting sequences. Now, regarding the acting, I did enjoy Ledger's portrayal of The Joker, but I think it's miles away from being an Oscar-worthy performance and I'm sure his tragic death contributed to his winning, at least to a certain extent. Christian Bale, wasn't exactly bad either but, his cold and distant Bruce Wayne could never compete with Robert Downey Jr's witty and sarcastic Tony Stark for instance. Obviously the two movies have different tones, but the point I'm making is, Bale lacks charisma. Aaron Eckhart was fine as Harvey-Dent; what really threw me off was the fact that his character went from being incorruptible to killing innocent people without so much as a twitch ,all this because his lover, Rachel Dawes, gets killed. This is poor and incoherent writing. Morgan Freeman, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Michael Caine have minor roles and aren't worth mentioning. It's really something, the level of hype around this film, and the favored public reaction, the thing is, The Dark Knight doesn't know what it wants to be and tries to hard, sometimes it's a comic adaptation, and then it turns into a deep philosophical exercise and things don't work that way. It lacks coherence and a strong screenplay.5/10"

Sign in to vote.,"Has the world gone insane?","This is my big question as of late when reading the rave reviews for this super-overrated trash heap. When people start comparing this to REAL masterpieces like "Lord of the Rings", thats where i have to draw the line. i mean seriously what the hell is wrong with these people. thankfully I'm not alone in feeling this way. and its a shame because I've been a batman fan all my life, ever since i first saw the brilliant 1989 Batman with Keaton and nicholson, 2 of my favorite actors. the film was and is magical. it defined what a Comic Book movie should be. i saw and loved all of the subsequent sequels, except the 4th film, obviously. and yes i love Adam wests hilarious portrayal as well. but even that 4th camp entry with Ahnuld was more watchable then these new ones. yes, i will take my bat credit card (exp date: Forever) right to the bank before i will watch TDK again. now its sad because i cant say im a batman fan without having to explain to people why i cant stand the new movies. i constantly have to say "oh i love the batman movies, the ORIGINAL movies, but not the new ones". its gets tiring. on top of all this, the fans/nerds of these films have created almost a cult like following who seem to literally worship nolan and his *lack of* vision. hes no tim burton. he doesn't have the style OR substance. i saw Batman Begins and thought it was just OK, but disappointing. i saw TDK back when it first came out. i, like most everyone else, was bought by the hype. but after seeing it twice, i came to the conclusion that most fans will not agree with: THIS IS NOT A BATMAN FILM. call it a crime drama. call it a Heat remake, but please don't have the nerve to call it a batman film, because its just not. more then that, its completely humorless and with not even a hint of comedy, unless you count the really stupid cop lines "i didn't sign up for this!" JEEEZ. thats bad. actually it was the lines that were unintentionally bad like "NO MO DEAD COPZ!". *rolles eye*. But what gets me is those that review this movie that its a great comic book adaptation. couldn't be further from the truth. a superhero movie to be good, has to actually at least somewhat resemble the comics. nolan looks to completely set his movies apart from the other ones that he completely misses the point and the fun of batman. "i will make my batman feel smart and intellectual". however all he does is make very long, boring, drab, serious movies that never acknowledge the fact that its about a man dressed in a halloween costume. thats what upset me more then anything else. it doesn't even have the word "batman" in the title! i think the director was playing it safe to an extent in the first one, which did at times feel more like a batman film, whereas this one felt like little more then an elongated episode of "law and order". look, i know CSI is popular on TV these days, but it doesn't belong in a batman film. when i think of batman, i think, BIG action, COOL batmobile, wacky, colorful villains and big bombastic musical score. BIG. every things gotta be big. thats what you got with the original films. this movie however is like batman on a budget. i could get this same lame average car chases from an episode of 24. but in a batman movie, every things supposed to be a heightened reality and more fantastical and like a comic book. pure escapism. but no, not this version. this is what I've come to call the "dull" batman. nothing about nolan's vision excites me, from the modern-day urban-grit makeover, to the facile 24 style anti-terrorist plots, to the uninspired flatly staged action scenes. according to most bat fans, nolan's is the best comic-book adaptation of all time, yet I can find nothing in these movies that is fascinated by its comic book sources and the films simply read to me as an uninspired extension of the modern "realistic gritty" action movie although it suffers by comparison from a lack of earnestness or gleefulness. not only is the direction all wrong, but its got NO good action scenes. what little action there is, is completely dull. batman rides that fugly tank thing to chase joker. he goes to hong Kong. nice. then he uses everyones cell phones (more stupid cell phone propaganda) to locate joker and then proceeds to get the crap beat out of him BY joker. then he rescues him! HAHA. the movie is so stupid. joker never got the beating he wholly deserved. the message of the film is disgusting and depressing, if you can even figure it out amidst all the constant psychobabble thats thrown around. two face was a write-off, reduced to a cameo, a footnote for what is usually a very cool villain. tommy lee Jones may have been a bit hammy, but he was damn entertaining! this version, like the film itself, is instantly forgettable. why is it taking everyone so long to take off the emperors new clothes? this movie is abysmal and the fact so many people enjoy it so much says something gravely disturbing about society. i think people need to wake up, go to church, rekindle there soul and get away from this overly serious mumbo jumbo. why so serious is right, only i want to ask the director that. these movies only inspire death and killings. you never heard this happening with the original batman movies. now look. pretty scary. but im sure this will only inspire holly-weird to make even MORE of these dark depressing soulless hype machines that will only inspire more killings and so on and so on."

Sign in to vote.,"Definitely not the best movie of all time, but extraordinary in its own league","Naturally, "The Dark Knight" doesn't deserve a #1 spot on a Top 250 list (it's ranked #1 on IMDb with a 9.4/10 rating out of 156, 218 votes as of July 28, 2008), but that's a silly discussion since everyone has a different favourite film and you can't expect "Citizen Kane" or "2001: A Space Odyssey" (neither of these is my fave, by the way) to be more popular than (good or bad) summer blockbusters on a virtual world populated mostly by teenagers who dig Michael Bay's flicks (and I hate to sound so arrogant here, I'm not trying to imply young people have no taste, I barely left my teenage years myself... but that's the average public, right?), thus these lists shouldn't be taken too seriously.That said, "The Dark Knight" promises and delivers, more than living up to the hype. Christopher Nolan made something even bigger and better than his "Batman Begins" (2005), topping Tim Burton's first two installments of the series (and let's not even mention Joel Schumacher's name... he doesn't need to be humiliated any more than he's been - let's just forget he exists). The movie works in epic proportions as the possible greatest superhero movie ever made, and easily the most exciting action movie in many years (and this is coming from someone who doesn't dig action flicks that much). The cast (Christian Bale, Heath Ledger, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Aaron Eckhart and Gary Oldman) is also the best in the whole series, and Ledger is clearly the standout (and trust me, he's THAT good, and all that praise isn't because of sentimental reasons): his Joker is a blast, psychotic, scary, hilarious and darkly charismatic. And if the buzz makes it to the end of the year, I can definitely see him getting a well deserved posthumous Oscar nomination for best supporting actor. Whether you're a huge Batman fan or just want a perfect summer flick, "The Dark Knight" shall not let you down. Bravo, Mr. Nolan - there's still intelligent life in Hollywood! 10/10."

9,4-Sep-08,lowellmontgomery,83,204,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"Why so much hype?","Okay, so they built a good villain in the Joker, but the plot was just a bit too unbelievable to hold together. I'm not going to add any spoilers here, but if you want a big-budget, action- adventure escape that totally relies on the rendering farms that had to handle all the special effects... and don't mind plot-holes the Hindenburg could fly through, this film is for you. IMHO, this film doesn't deserve all the hype. Look at reviews from people who "hated it" and see why. Once the hype has died down and people get over their brainwash to overrate this over-produced Hollywood crap, we should see ratings more in line with the film's true value. I didn't walk out, but that was because I had such high expectations. I'd hope to see this rated a '4', maybe even as high as a '6' by the average public. I'm rating this a '1' to try to offset the obvious shills and excessive hype. This is, by no means, "the best film of the summer"... but in its favor, it does give better balance to the darkness of Batman. If it weren't for the growing trend in bucking the old "feel-good Hollywood ending" routine... if it weren't becoming cliché to kill off "good guys" and create characters with seeming hearts of gold, who turn half-evil, I'd say this film had something unique; but that whole scenario is now a formula for making a film armchair critics will say has "depth"... pffff... Save your time and money and rent an old classic favorite that you somehow never managed to see. Or go have a picnic with your loved ones. The alternative is two-and-a-half hours you won't get back; don't waste it to further enrich Warner Bros."

Sign in to vote.,"Impressive blockbuster with dark tone, plot, characters and delivery making its satisfyingly "grown-up"","Batman has proved successful in cleaning up the streets and a fresh new DA, Harvey Dent, is keen to clean up the mobsters in one big conspiracy case. Naturally an unpopular move, particularly with the psychotic villain known as "The Joker", who makes it his mission to unveil the identity of the Batman, before killing him. The Joker begins his reign of terror, forcing the citizens of Gotham to wonder whether or not it was worth having a Batman if this is the sort of chaos that his presence unleashes. With the stakes raised higher than ever, Bruce Wayne struggles to hold onto his moral code in the face of villain whose only aim is to unleash chaos and panic across the city.I waited a few weeks for all the hype to die down, but I was looking forward to seeing this film because Batman Begins had done a great job of repairing a character and franchise that was in tatters as Schumacher's gaudy and unlikeable Happy Meal-selling film had finished with it. I was hoping for more of the same as The Dark Knight did not disappoint as the tone continues to be dark and as realistic as a film can be when it is about a man dressed as a bat. The film is a summer blockbuster but yet it manages to at least get close to a really engaging and interesting plot  this is a joyful far cry from The Fantastic Four and the like, this feels like a film that is marketed to me, not my children. As such the plot does offer some good moralising and conflicts that are what I expected from the damaged "hero" of Batman and the freaks he is up against. Again, it is not a "proper" drama but these elements are effective within the bigger picture and they only help draw the viewer into the story and characters.The fact that it does engage also means that the action is much more effective. I watched Wanted the other night where everything was so simplistic and dumb that I never cared and the action was only effects. Here the tone is deadly serious and the action feels urgent and dangerous. This has produced the problem in the UK over the rating and I do think that it should have been a 15, although I can understand why it got a 12A. Problem for the certification body is that the film doesn't contain much in the way of graphic acts but it is the tone that is so very harsh and dark, thus making it feel much more violent than it actually is. For me this is not a problem as the film is not for children and I am not a child, but I can sort of see why The Daily Mail jumped on it as the destruction of the mankind or whatever they said it was going to do to our children. I do like the dark tone though and it is not just a visual thing or something in a specific few scenes but rather woven through the whole film. It starts with the characters and performances and of course comes across in the direction and cinematography, which is suitably dark and Gothic without being camp or unrealistic.The cast do good work but all are in the shadow of Ledger  not because it is fashionable to praise him but because his is a great turn and makes the film. I do feel sorry for Jack Nicholson because his Joker now looks like a childishly simple creation that is a bit of cheesy fun but no more. With Ledger we genuinely feel unnerved with him on the screen, his clothes and make-up being all part of this unhinged creation with his ticks and hair-trigger air; his performance is part of the film working as well as it does as he sells the character and the material. If he does get an Oscar nod, it will not (just) be for sympathy, but because he genuinely is that good. Bale finds himself a supporting player in his own film but deals with it well; not sure about his laughably gruff voice as Batman though  it just distracts. Eckhart is a good bit of casting because he normally plays morally dubious characters, so the contrast works at the start and he can work with the later stages. Gyllenhaal has her critics but she is much better than Holmes and stands up well with the all-male cast. The supporting cast offer the usual quality in Oldman, Caine and Freeman as well as other faces in minor roles such as Roberts, a returning Murphy, Carbonell, McFarlane, White, Fichtner, Lister and others.The Dark Knight is a great film. The dark tone, good plotting, strong characters, performances and overall design and delivery all make for a grown-up blockbuster that is heads and shoulders above its peers. Ledger is impressive and drives the film forward in an adult and engaging way. Parents with the legal ability to take their four year olds should think twice, because this is not a kiddie blockbuster, but for everyone else there is a great deal to enjoy here."

Sign in to vote.,"Sledgehammer Body Shots.","Like a heavyweight prizefight with nothing but stellar body blows and pinpoint accurate jabs, "The Dark Knight" is an amazing achievement which transcends the previous "Batman" installments and all other products from the suspect superhero genre. With shades of Martin Scorsese and Michael Mann apparent from the outset, director/co-writer Christopher Nolan turns the concept into a cop and robbers epic with vivid characters in every direction, dizzying outcomes, and a truly intelligent and emotional story for the masses. The famed title character (Christian Bale) is continuing to take down high-level crime associates (led by Eric Roberts), double-crossing middle men, and low-rent would-be cutthroats. However, a new evil is about to pop up---a crazed mad man with war paint (the late Heath Ledger) who is robbing Gotham's criminal element of millions in crazed bank robberies. Now The Joker has a deviant plan to take down Batman by blackmailing the city's underworld power players in an all-out war for supremacy in a metropolitan area which is quickly becoming a war-zone with domestic terrorism taking center-stage. District Attorney Aaron Eckhart looks to take on the criminal elements head-on with the help of assistant Maggie Gyllenhaal (taking Katie Holmes' part from "Batman Begins") and police lieutenant Gary Oldman who still seems to be the only law enforcement officer who is definitely on the level. Bale's want and need for a regular life makes it appear Eckhart could truly be the city's "White Knight", but in this chaotic chess match there will be battles aplenty with unpredictable and demoralizing outcomes. Unforgettable masterpiece which is a film noir-styled triumph of style and substance. Ledger's part is amazing as he turns a literal comic book caricature into a cunning, complex, difficult, enigmatic, and mysterious mad man with brutal psychotic tendencies and strange viewpoints. He is the brightest flame in a film of constant fire and surprising fireworks. Every performer is on target, however---from Bale's tortured Bruce Wayne/Batman to role players Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Anthony Michael Hall, and Cillian Murphy (in a very short cameo). Beautifully filmed (primarily on the streets of Chicago), expertly edited, and masterfully crafted, "The Dark Knight" lives up to its unbelievable hype and goes way beyond its would-be limitations with staggering cinematic elements which can only be found in landmark productions. 5 stars out of 5."

Yes the reviews where all brightly glowing, but even still it was above expectations.Everybody in the movie played their part extremely well, from the leads to the support. The plot was clever and complex enough that it got the old grey matter working. The direction, score and script were top drawer, the overall feel of quality throughout was second to none.I have to say experiencing the film on the giant I.M.A.X screen enhanced the viewing pleasure even further. The scene's they filmed with the I.M.A.X. camera's looked quite simply EPIC.10/10 no flaws in my opinion.

It Showed us how the Batman is meant to be and how he should be treated on the movie screen. The Dark Knight takes that movie one step further. And in doing so gives us perhaps the most realistic portrayal of The Batman and The Joker EVER! The Late Heath Ledger gave easily the performance of a lifetime with some actors you can see where the role ends and they begin or vice versa. But not here. Ledger immersed himself so completely into the Role of the Joker it's as if he was channeling the Criminal's personality, Chilling is the word I use for Heath Ledger he does not stop he continues until the very end of the movie giving a 100 percent a brilliant portrayal from a extremely talented actor. Christian Bale moves on and not only BETTERS his performance from the first Batman he adds layers to Bruce Wayne and Batman he shows us just how crazy it must be to be Batman and still have people you love and walk that tightrope in trying to protect them. Or protecting his city. Batman makes a New Ally alongside James Gordon and that is the crusading fearless D.A. Harvey Dent. Aaron Eckhart gives a strong performance but he is a little weak considering just who he's playing against. But Eckhardt compensates for his weaknesses but underplaying his role at times and then overplaying it keeping us on the edge of our seat making his Harvey Dent dangerous and unpredictable. Gary Oldman gives us a strong James Gordon who wants to play with the rules and the Gordon who envies Batman's freedom in doing what needs to be done. This then is how it's SUPPOSE to be done in as Grand a style and action that's so EPIC you sit in awe of the stunts and effects. And The WAy it needs to be The Batman VS The Joker on the greatest battlefield of all GOTHAM CITY. This is the film that should go down as the greatest Comic book adaptation and all the new ones should watch and learn from it. Well Worth seeing."

9,31-Jul-08,fantasyescapist,5,10,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"The Dark Knight is an intelligent, gripping comic book film that lived up to the hype for me.","At the time of writing this, I haven't yet seen Batman Begins, as Batman and Robin unfortunately had put me off further film adaptations of the caped crusader, but this has easily re-ignited my liking of, what I think, is the most interesting, conflicted and hugely popular superhero that I know. Batman's heroic status is in question so are morals, and even someone put on a pedestal can fall from grace.Acting: One man steals every scene he's in with a brilliantly insane performance, and that's the late Ledger. He's anarchy personified and a twisted, puzzling villain who says earlier in the film 'what doesn't kill you makes you stranger' or something. He's definitely not your ordinary antagonist and brings complex sadism to it that truly disturbed me  the clownish makeup isn't so much theatrical as a reflection of pathological madness. This crazed makeup tells us the disorder The Joker craves in Gotham city. Bale plays both of the character's identities: Wayne's suavity and Batman's serious, tortured and savage superhero with ease and believability. My only annoyance was the deeply gruff voice he uses as Batman. Eckhart's Dent, although I was more interested in the Joker, his evolution into Two-Face was intriguing and a particular intensely suspenseful moment near the end had my crowded screening silent enough to hear a pin drop. He became quite chilling as Two-Face and certain flashes of evil in his eyes were creepy. When the audience sees what happens to his face to get that name may scare quite some children. Oldman was subtlety brilliant in his cop role  very natural and convincing. Maggie Gyllenhall and Freeman were good too in this ensemble piece but of course; don't get as much screen time as the main characters.Pacing: I like the way Nolan's made a gritty, more realistic take on Batman and it knowingly brings more attention from even just your average cinema-goer to be more affected by events happening and relate it to our world today. The film is long, and that's mainly because so many subplots are happening, some don't get followed through as our focus is then shifted to the main event  Batman vs. Joker. The inclusion of Dent to me, as interesting as it is, is just a sideshow for the face-off main show, as said previously. There is a good balance of the action with the talking scenes and the action's very much essential to tell the story in many ways and not a flashy, shallow disconnected-to-the-plot-completely sense. A slight lack of emotional involvement as well when a character dies, but maybe that's just me.Cinematography and SFX: Due to its dark nature, this is shown in its look too. A lot of brown and blues are used well, with good lighting, so you aren't squinting  it's beautifully shot. The bat suit, car and a key invention used by Batman to see people are well realised, explosions and action sequences are very well constructed. It's all staged in an epic, iconic way.Music: I don't think I hear the known Batman theme really, but the score was simple but worked really good.Overall: A dark, brooding and intelligent comic-book film that leaves the other two released so far this year (Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk) standing, left behind to gaze in awe. Quotes from characters can later manifest themselves in situations, and also, how ingenious the title of the film actually is when you see the ending. A psychotic villain tops it off an unsettling and tragic film. It's so much braver and inventive than any other comic-book film I've seen, probably ever. The only blockbuster film this year so far that lived up to the hype for me.Last note: please parents, this is something too long and frankly complex for most kids under 12, so take them to a PG or U rated film instead - seeing three-year-olds in the cinema screening makes me despair for common sense. The 12A certificate clearly is meant for 12 and up - younger than that, and any complaints you get from your youngsters that it disturbs them is your fault. Consider yourselves pre-warned - 12A is NOT the equivalent of a PG, and even some PG's are not suitable for all kids."

9,17-Sep-08,angelsfang,5,10,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"Breathtaking cinema.","I am speaking figuratively. You know those moments where you find yourself holding your breath? That's how I felt when viewing Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight. This movie is epic. I am not a big Batman fan, I don't own any comics, only read a few when I was a kid. And I have not felt this way since Jackson's Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. But they are two completely different genres, LOTR was a CGI fest in a fantasy world, The Dark Knight is just fantastic direction in a (reasonably) realistic setting, a compelling storyline with many twists, gripping suspense, heart-thumping battles and brilliant music. I noticed that this time, there was more of a suspenseful ambiance type of sound or beat during the action scenes, rather than just the looped music that was present in Batman Begins, which made the scenes look more like music videos. The Dark Knight is true to its name, very dark indeed.This is a movie that you simply cannot see it just once, and I highly recommend multiple theatre viewings before buying the remastered DVD version. It's ranked #3 in the IMDb Top 250 at the time of this review, perhaps a little bit high in my opinion, but definitely top 20 material, maybe even 10. Time will tell if it can stay there.Christian Bale puts in one of hiss usual shifts, and anyone who has seen his movies (The Machinist, American Psycho, Reign of Fire) knows what he can do. Maggie Gyllenhaal delivers, and puts in a very mature and believable performance that surpasses her predecessor. But Heath Ledger is the joker here, pun intended. He really shocked me with what he can do despite all the hype and trailers I had viewed beforehand, and hiding behind his hideous makeup gives him even more freedom and confidence to fully express and release himself. The unique thing about his Joker that makes him so successful is that he is not only intriguing to the audience, he still does a phenomenal job in making you loathe him. Many villains in other movies go over the top these days, which makes the viewer respect them in awe, but in the end fail to achieve their most important objective; the villain needs to be hated! You can't have the audience start feeling sorry for them, unless their character was intended that way. The Joker makes you shake your head in both awe, and disgust. Absolutely brilliant. Just like the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Heath Ledger has raised the bar considerably, and put immense pressure on the next guy to play the villain, not just in Batman films but other superhero flicks as well. Eventually his performance may be surpassed, but it sure won't be easy and won't be too soon either! I daresay The Dark Knight could not only be the movie of the year, but also the movie of the decade. Around halfway into the movie, I was already reeling, I glanced at my watch and was shocked to realized it was only halfway. This is the kind of movie that you never want to end."

Hawthorne's "Young Goodman Brown" I have a strong urge to downgrade Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight to a B for BEING too long, for BEARING too many anti-climaxes, BUT it also happens to BE the best super-hero movie of the summer and one of the BEST comic book adaptations ever. This praise has little to do with Heath Ledger's memorable turn as The Joker, so good it will instantaneously make you forget Jack Nicholson's famous rendition.What really qualifies Dark Knight is the titular fulfillment: Not only does Christian Bale's Batman become dark, almost every major character goes through a dark night of the soul, except the ruleless Joker, for whom evil is a playful way of living out his days. The characters are challenged by the evil and goodness of humanity and of themselves. Like many of us, being good for these characters ironically involves personal vanity and a vulnerability to love.So ingenious is the script that at any one point, multiple good guys could be bad with the flip of a coin. District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is a case in point: He becomes the new Gotham hero by rounding up the usual mob suspects; he becomes a problematic warrior in the real struggle of the soul, whereby he must reconcile his inherently virtuous soul with the requisite means of fighting evil, a moral trap the Joker plays well.Dark Knight easily buddies up with Iron Man's ambiguity this summer as it pokes the audience with quandaries about the endless and tiring clash with evil (read 9/11 and the Iraq War) and the means to revenge or end the mayhem (read Neocon strategies). However if you don't wish to indulge these allegorical fancies, just enjoy cinematographer Wally Pfister's transformation of Chicago into a fantasy land almost better than a comic book's art.But the film doesn't leave the people of Gotham and presumably the audience out of the mix either, for they all must make choices from as banal as blowing up a boat to as profound as tracking down their saviors, The agent of evil, the Joker, makes believable the racking decisions he maneuvers for private citizens and public officials. In the end, they are in control of their moral choicesthe joke's on them.As Joker says, "What doesn't kill you makes you stranger.""

Anyway, the film is by far the darkest superhero film I have ever seen.Heath Ledger did excellent in his chilling portrayal of The Joker, every scene he was in brought a mix of dark humor and scariness to the table. Micheal Caine, Gary Oldman & Christan Bale also did quite well.Onto the bulk of the film, I felt the movie was going great up until the hospital blew up, from that point on some very unneeded action scenes took place. The film would have been MUCH better if they just went to the final scene and cut out the boat bit.The length was also a factor, many scenes could and should have been cut.Overall, this is a dark and depressing superhero flick with some excellent performances, but it falls apart a bit in the final act. 8.5/10 I liked Begins more."

Let's flash back to 2008 for a second; you're telling me it made over a BILLION as far back as then? Before all that Avatar, 2.7 billion crap? I know there are other movies from beforehand that made this amount of money -- and perhaps a lot more -- but are they the same in regards to quality? No. they're not. The Dark Knight is regarded by many as one of the greatest movies of all time. I can kind of agree with this and I definitely understand why somebody would think this. In terms of perfection, however, that's one thing it is not. I believe -- and I know people out there will agree -- that there truly only is one perfect Batman movie, and that's the first instalment in this trilogy, Batman Begins. This movie is fantastic though, and yes, truly we get one of the finest and most astounding acting performances we've seen on the big screen - Heath Ledger's Joker. Is he my favourite portrayal of the character? I think he possibly could be, movie wise. Overall, I'm certain in saying the performance goes to Mark Hamill. But this is a massively noteworthy and genius performance. I just wish Heath Ledger were alive to see it and to see how much fame and love and admiration he got for this stunning portrayal of one of the best antagonists we've seen or known. Christian Bale is fantastic yet again, too. That Batman voice is awful, though. Still awful. But other than that, great acting. He's a good Batman and a brilliant Bruce Wayne if you ask me. The Dark Knight definitely gets a solid 8, perhaps 8.1./10 from me for its fine acting, direction, cinematography, choreography and for the its chemistry between actors/characters and the dialogue -- specifically between The Joker and The Caped Crusader. An amazing film overall."

It was two hours and thirty minutes, but it felt half as short. I loved every minute of it. It was gripping, shocking, moving, funny, and clever. Christian Bale took his strange persona he had in BATMAN BEGINS and ratcheted it up a notch and a half. I can't imagine a better Batman. Maggie Gyllenhaal did an even better job than Katie Holmes did and managed to make me forget that she was Maggie Gyllenhaal. Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, and Morgan Freeman were all top notch as they usually are. Heath Ledger's performance as The Joker was absolutely chilling and incredible. He was like a deranged combination of Jack Nicholson, Cesar Romero, Brandon Lee in THE CROW, Malcolm McDowell as Alex DeLarge in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, and Tadanobu Asano as Kakihara in ICHI THE KILLER. I'd say that his performance was worth an Oscar, except that Aaron Eckhart as Harvy Dent was just as incredible. I don't want to spoil anything, but his performance will most certainly be remembered as one of the most emotional and unforgettable performances in a superhero film. He does just as good a job as Heath Ledger, who already did an immense and perfect job. I hate to call the film a superhero movie though, because it is much much MUCH more than that. It is an ensemble piece. This film is just as much about Batman as it is about Commissioner Gordon and Harvey Dent. All three characters are explored to such an incredible depth that it doesn't feel at all like a superhero movie. That's not to say that the film doesn't have it's fair share of action, because the action scenes in this film are extraordinary. The actions scenes in this film are not only satisfying, but they are also incredibly intense, unpredictable, and, they actually move the story. As if the film isn't perfect enough, it also manages to accomplish even more. The film feels like a crime saga in the vein of something like THE UNTOUCHABLES, THE DEPARTED, and, yes, even THE CROW. This is a magnificent film and a gem and it deserves to be remembered as a milestone in the realm of great superhero movies. This is a great film and I highly recommend it.PROS:-everything that was great about the original is multiplied.-extraordinary performances by Aaron Eckhart, Christian Bale, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Heath Ledger-perfect visuals, action scenes, fast pace, and storyCONS:-Obviously, some suspension of disbelief is definitely required for a superhero movie."

Sign in to vote.,"The Dark & Humourless Night","It was a trade show - days before the film's release - I had tickets - I was excited - I was going to see The Dark Knight: Chris Nolan's second Batman film after the promising start he had made with Batman Begins...I had heard Oscar mentions about the late Heath Ledger, and I couldn't wait to see what they had done with the reinvention of The Joker - which I hoped went back to the graphic novels - harsh and insane, but tinged with a little sympathy on our part for what is ultimately a tragic character.Unfortunately, we got none of this. The movie plods along a path of politically thriller which would suit any vigilante film, except this is Batman - and you could live with it - except there's no light here. The only slight humour in the entire film features Michael Caine (as Alfred the Buttler) and then it's all doom and gloom...I liked seeing the mechanics of how people support Bruce Wayne in his Batman guise; it's interesting. But the pace is never more than pedestrian unless we're thrown headlong into one of the action sequences - which are excellent, of course. But so what?!! I didn't care about anyone, so I didn't really become emotionally involved with anyone to care if they lived or died. Christian Bale plays Batman with such merciless grimace that it's hard to understand why anyone would speak to him, let alone support him.All in all the story culminates at around the 2 hour mark with spectacular orchestration and manipulation - and you think 'I can't wait for the sequel' - and then, unfortunately, the film continues for another 30 minutes of action which would be better placed in a whole other movie. By which time you are so numb that you just want to run from the cinema while rubbing the feeling back into your arse cheeks!The afore mentioned Heath Ledger IS superb. He's the only light in this humourless darkness. I only wish they had gone back to the comic material and given him a proper background. It would have added such depth to what is an extraordinary performance.It's such a shame that after stunningly inventive and interesting movies like Memento, Insomnia and The Prestige that Chris Nolan has been given enough rope to hang himself with. Batman Begins was too long and warning flags should have been waving. And yet with films costing more than ever, this movie could have cut it's running time and budget by 20%. I could be wrong, but I think the prohibitive length and dour humourless tone it takes could mean it's market cutting shorter than it could otherwise have performed.Also a word to parents: This is not a kids film. It's violent, a little sadistic, and bares an adult sensibility throughout. Frankly, even if kids were allowed to watch it they would be bored stiff, fidget, talk and possibly fall asleep.This is not a masterpiece. It's not rubbish. It's a very very long dark night."

There is subtle disharmony in the spheres that our current tools cannot adequately support, I am faced with this in a variety of recent films I see about some cosmic dimension, from Cremaster to The Avengers. Something like this, that has room for discord and emptiness, was discovered several millenia ago in India at around the same time as the mathematical zero (and by the same folks), but the world went with the Greek symmetrical model for reason and drama.And there is nothing particularly reasonable in a mother-child relationship, or deep love, or even good sex or humor, or anything that is powerful in life. The sun always rises from the east, that is reasonable enough, but feelings don't: sometimes they rise from the west, sometimes night bleeds into day, sometimes they rise from both places at once and we get two moons at noon.This is dismaying to me, because film can and should be, by inherent design, the tools to explore and deliver infinite extra-logical variations of that mysterious noon sky that is illogical and dissolves reasonable thought, and we use it to illustrate plays that aim to solve. And here is a film about inherent chaos in the universe and the failure of logical tools to adequately solve and explain.Nolan is just not up to it. He crafts a solid film, no doubt. The action is a bit less generic than previous. The storyline more coherent and believable. But he is an entirely logical being, simply not mad enough. He's all about exerting control over the world he creates, and that is reflected inside the film as several schemers vying to manipulate the narrative and reality (a motif carried over from Begins). And this is a film about chaos, which means you have to let go at some point and see what pieces of the story fall from the sky, which is the essence of what was discovered in India: being still through the thing (the mind)(the world) spinning by itself until the machinery dissolves.Nolan simply can't do this. He knows The Joker is closer to the center of the universe than anyone. He knows everyone else is going to be inadequate and profoundly boring in their quest for responsibility, compared to the sexiness of that destructive force. Ledger knew this, and brought together in his role rude , illogical swagger from George Carlin all the way to Johnny Rotten.Up until a point, they really get it right: this man cannot be trusted, to tell his story or otherwise, and us sorting through the false stories looking for truth is moot in the face of this man embodying in action the truth of what he is. Everyone in the film seriously puzzles to communicate what he's all about and why.But Nolan just can't bring himself to not explain, again and again, that some people just want to see the world burn. We just don't have actual Joker-vision, something fluid from the other side of reason.This is important. This character affects so deeply, because there is nothing to think about or explain, since he won't give away anything, so you are left with no other option than to be still as he spins the world this way and that. He has the role played by invisible fates in film noir, and the allure of that was there was something you couldn't fathom but apparently had mechanism, agency. This is a backwards step. And you just know that every explanation is going to be profoundly disappointing, which is precisely the gist of why our cognitive tools are inadequate: that deeply-rooted illogical self that is capable for motherhood and awe-inspiring sex alike can recognize that words are never the thing they describe. They are at best the campfire tale between hunters about the day's hunt.I am not saying chaos is good, or simply that it affects. I'm saying everything that is unreasonable does, because it confounds and dissolves thought. I'm saying the presentation here disappoints, because it doesn't have truly irrational flow. We need more of both in our meditation.The film does reflect everything it's about in its solid structure, all of it a matter of static engineering, control, opera. It's dockyard work. In terms of cinematic flow, I envision what I'm talking about - the new set of tools - as something that requires a combination of aeronautics and telepathy, a design for both how the object moves and how the air moves around it.Have a look at Nolan's aerial views and tell me what you think. ."

Sign in to vote.,"You could hear a pin drop in the audience ... and it was packed.","The first thing I want to say is that this movie is lengthy, so after you see it, you will probably forget how many things actually transpired in it. However, if you see various clips afterward, it's easy to get a deeper appreciation of how much effort was put into the film.One thing I won't soon forget is how I had to buy my ticket a day in advance for an IMAX showing. It was almost a full week after it opened - and it was a weekday during work hours ... and the show was still sold out. When the movie started, there were several generations of moviegoers in the audience and everyone was dead-quiet silent and focused on the movie - including me.THE MOVIE: Even though I wouldn't call it "perfect" (you can find things to squabble with), overall it was great.The strengths are the story, characters, visuals and special effects. The basic setup is that a new criminal surfaces in Gotham City. He is a menace not only to the local authorities, but also to the well-established mob families operating in city. Eventually, he cracks a deal with the mob to get rid of Batman ... but this is only the beginning of this incredible story.One best things about the movie is that is has time to develop a complex storyline and intense characters. It's an hour longer than most movies (2 1/2 vs. 1 1/2 hours) and as a result, a lot of things happen (with well-done twists) and you really get a well-rounded, sophisticated story. In fact, one of the best things about the movie are the thought-provoking ideas that it leaves you with.The characters and performances are also really well done across the board. However, Heath Ledger's (the Joker) performance was mesmerizing. His character wasn't ridiculous (as most comic book enemies are), but fascinating, believable and ever-so engrossing. Even though Christian Bale had the title role, his performance couldn't quite eclipse Ledger's.The visuals in the movie were spectacular. The city of Gotham was finally made to like a real major city and the wide-angle cityscape shots were beautifully done. The scenes with Batman on top of high skyscrapers and the inner city details were also great. But again, Ledger was stunning in the role: the scenes of the hunched Joker walking through the streets at night, or of him with his upper torso crazily flailing outside of the policecar window are powerful.And special effects ... well, aside from the cool 'Bat' vehicles and extremely well-constructed explosions, some of the best effects are unexpected ones - such as some the jumps Batman does and unexpected ways he crafts his escapes (I won't spoil any of those).In short - don't miss this. See it in a theater and see it before you start hearing/seeing too much about it in the media or from others. This is one of the best values you will ever get for price of a movie ticket."

Sign in to vote.,"amazing! a Batman film and so much more","It's a critical time for Gotham City: behind the strength of Batman less citizens are living in fear, yet the last remnants of the mob still seek to claim the city for themselves. Teamed with prominent cop Lt. Jim Gordon and golden boy D.A. Harvey Dent, Batman meets his match in The Joker—a wily, sadistic anarchist out to send a message to the citizens of Gotham. It's hard to envision director Nolan crafting a better sequel, transcending the simple boundaries of the comic book genre and creating a powerful tale of fate and chance, morality and justice, sacrifice and redemption that's rich in emotion and nuance, large-scale action scenes, ingenious plotting, and strong characterizations. In his final film, the late Heath Ledger (he died tragically following the film's completion) is nothing short of astounding, creating a deranged and remorseless evil genius whose threat to the hero is formidable. The most major criticism is that it goes on too long, with a few climaxes too many, but it's hard to complain while viewing such masterful storytelling. Too dark and edgy for the youngest audiences but still solid entertainment, arguably destined to be a classic. ***½"

I'm not sold on that logic. Scarier does not have to seem better than funnier. Alfred Hitchcock did a great job of using both horror and comedy to considerable advantage. In fact Hitchcock personally considered 'Psycho' a comedy. The point is that we have to laugh at the absurdity of these increasingly bleak and dark renditions of the world in which we live. If we begin to take it seriously and call it the best, the greatest ever, and the film of the year, we are then arrogantly getting caught up in the hype. I don't want to hear repeatedly that it's the best Batman movie thus far. I want to hear if it makes us think about the world we live in, and if it's pessimistic as all that, then look at the facts and see what can be changed. Otherwise it's an irresponsible chronicle of life in the year 2008 and it won't hold up."

Well, i was a bit disappointed with the film. Not that it is a bad film. It is a solid work, and a good ride with someone who has some interesting things to say in narrative construction.Basically: Joker is a pivot to a complex narration device, where everybody, bad guys, or good guys, is completely clueless about what will happen with them or in Gotham. The Joker plays the game, he is the central key to this plot. He defines the rules, and the rules are incidental even in his thinking, he acts randomly, kills by chance. Chaos through unpredictability. It's great. Everybody has the job to survive, except to characters: Batman, who follows Joker and tries to "unmask" the plan (without unmasking himself), and Dent, who tries directly to attack Joker, also to unmask him, but in a more direct, straightforward, "honest" way. That's why he is looked upon as the true hero of Gotham, even by the Batman. That's why he is turned over and twisted to become the 'good' enemy. It's a game of oppositions, clear sides, the two faces of everybody. The unfolding of the game is, of course, when Joker looses guidance over the unguided destinies of the facts.So this is actually phenomenal cinematic story-telling. It's not visual, it doesn't even attempt at being fully visual as, for example, 'Batman Begins' tried (and partially achieved), but it's a great structure in the line of recent works like the life-altering 'Oldboy'.What made me disappointed was the high expectations made by an unbelievable #4th place in IMDb top 250, and the smashing positive reviews by almost everybody i read. OK, i should have seen it coming, the reason for this was the effect of Ledger's premature death. He really shows skill and true talent here, and his character is involved in an aura of darkness that exists because Ledger deals with the contradictions of this character, the constant smile versus the darkness of spirit. He is conscious about his own acting, so he "laughs" at his character, and his role. It's very hard to do that, at least rare to watch. So everything in this film is solid. But it isn't ambitious enough to make me dream beyond certain horizons which, in my view, stay way below the "4th best film ever".So, i have to place reviews and general opinions into perspective. If i had seen this in the theatre when it came out, before the avalanche of empowering reviews around Ledger's performance, i might have taken it for what it is. Like this, i was unfairly disappointed with this powerful film.My opinion: 4/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com"

Not an alien who flies and is indestructible, a chap bitten by a spider or some fellow whose arms and legs extend all over the place. This is more than just a Batman movie.There is something fundamentally disturbing about this movie that it keeps one riveted through it. Good v Evil is too hackneyed a reason. There have been different kinds of evil and dementia captured well on screen - "Silence of the Lambs", "The Shining", "Apocalypse Now", "Touch of Evil" to name a few of my favourites. This one pushes the line between sane and insane, good and evil by actually blurring them. One is often left rooting for the Joker in a sort of perverse way - just to see what reaction would be drawn from Batman.Heath Ledger delivers a sensational interpretation of the Joker - I am sure his soul will rest more in peace knowing that this role would be remembered for a long time. The look, the demonic laugh and above all the serpentine flick of his tongue complete what is one of the most effective villains of our time on screen. If Nicholson was funny and almost ridiculous, Ledger was just pure evil - meaningless malignity.The rest of the movie - the special effects, batman's fall from virtue so that he can get the better of the joker etc - all seems to pass in a blur while the indelible image of the Joker remains in our minds. Too bad Ledger wont be there when Batman gets back - however the Joker will in all probability remain"

When I first saw Batman Begins, I was expecting something decent, something that would hopefully be better than Batman and Robin, and I came out of the theatre amazed. Batman Begins was the best comic book movie ever made. Was being the key element. It no longer is, The Dark Knight, without a doubt is the best comic book movie ever made, and in my opinion, one of the best movies ever made. Christopher Nolan never disappoints, and his follow up to Begins was The Prestige, also a favorite of mine. The Dark Knight destroys all his others, though. It is truly amazing, nothing lacking in it at all. Mr. Nolan seems incapable of doing a bad job writing or directing. Actually that's a horrid way of saying it. He seems incapable of writing or directing anything that isn't phenomenal, this being no exception. He wrote with his brother, Jonathon Nolan, and the pair seem a fantastic writing team, for the screenplay is Oscar-worthy. The acting. . .Of course when you have such amazing actors as Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Aaron Eckhart, Gary Oldman, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and the late Heath Ledger, you can't really get your movie's acting compared to the acting of a Sci-Fi Channel original movie. All the actors are perfect for the roles, especially the replacement of Katie Holmes. I know I will probably get killed for saying so, but, I wouldn't exactly say it would be a crime not to nominate Ledger for an Oscar, I mean, yes, he WAS the Joker. No doubt about it, he was that man, and did a great job with it, but it his whole role wasn't really so jaw dropping that he needs to get the award or the Academy is just evil. All the music, cinematography, special effects, stunts, makeup, all were perfect. This is very near a perfect movie. I really don't have any problems with it at all. I fear that even with Nolan & company back, part three in the series will never be able to live up to The Dark Knight. With Nolan, of course, we won't be getting another X-Men: The Last Stand, but I don't know if they can top The Dark Knight. I loved this movie, and I loved everything about this movie. As with Batman Begins, but even more-so, when I walked out of the theatre, I couldn't stop smiling."

Without giving anything away, Heath Ledger's Joker was simply a villain that could give Batman a run for his money. I have never seen such a powerful villain, not because the Joker has super powers, but because the Joker truly understands Batman. I was also tired of incompetence in villains. We've all seen it before- the villain screwed up epically and the superhero quickly takes advantage.The Joker is not prune to mistakes, let me tell you that much.It is obvious that Nolan was inspired by "The Killing Joke" by Alan Moore."

To have this in the top ten movies of all time is a travesty. Is it a good movie? It's not bad. But is it worthy to be the tenth best of all time? Absolutely not.Christian Bale, as I've thought about the first movie, is not Batman. The gruff angry voice isn't intimidating. It's annoying. Even as Bruce Wayne he's lacking. Lowering your voice and growling at people doesn't make you a good actor, nor does it make a good character.I'm not going to go into plot specifics, but I just have my thoughts to say. Besides Christian Bale butchering the Batman character, there's the same complains I had about this movie as the first one with him in it. The Batcave isn't a cave. It's a warehouse. The Batmobile is a tank. It's not a car and it's not even cool looking. It's angular and bulky and horrific.In conclusion, the movie is lacking a lot. Heath Ledger did a good job, but that was about it. The action was good, but Christian Bale ruined it for me. I don't believe how people can be that fooled by this movie that they'll put it at #10."

He has given us lengthy, intriguing, well acted, well shot, greatly written masterpieces. This is no exception. I saw this film in the theater and then re-watched it a few years later to have a better understanding of it. The story line is based around multiple events (which is why it's hard to pin down a plot, other than The Joker trying to get to Batman), most of which can, in some way, be traced back to the Joker (such as the beginning heist scene when he has it set up so that all his henchmen will kill each other one-by-one, leaving him with all the money). If for nothing else, watch it for The Joker, for which deceased actor Heath Ledger won a posthumous Oscar (much deserved). Of course, credit must also be given to Aaron Eckhart for his great portrayal of Two-Face, as he is one of the best characters in the entire film. Sometimes it can be hard to listen to Christian Bale's lost-voiced dialogue as the Caped Crusader, but anyone who is annoyed by this will soon look past it to realize the true masterpiece that this film is."

So I had huge expectations for this movie. So I went to see THE DARK KNIGHT on opening day in IMAX and boy it didn't disappoint. It was fantastic from the get go. It was so good I went to see it again in IMAX a couple of days later.Once again the cast are all top notch, each bringing class to their respective roles. Christian Bale again plays BATMAN, and though he is overshadowed by the sublime performance by Heath Ledger as the JOKER, he is once again terrific as both BRUCE WAYNE and BATMAN, firmly establishing himself as my favorite of all the actors to play THE DARK KNIGHT.The supporting cast of Michael Caine (ALFRED), Morgan Freeman (LUCIUS FOX), Gary Oldman (JAMES GORDON) and Aaron Eckhart (HARVEY DENT) are in top form. The direction is great, Christopher Nolan has fast turned into one of my favorite directors. All five films (BATMAN BEGINS, THE DARK KNIGHT, MEMENTO, THE PRESTIGE and INSOMNIA) of his that I've watched have all been great films.The films running time is at 150 minutes, which can normally drag a film on, but not this. Each passing minute on screen is a joy to be hold.This is an epic movie on all levels, and in today's market it cost only $185m to make, which is astonishing compared to $230m which is what QUANTUM OF SOLACE cost, and that doesn't go anywhere near the quality of this film. I've already seen this film 3 times, and I've preordered it off Amazon for its release on December 8th. For a film of this beauty Blu Ray is the only option when buying this.10*/10"

In fact, I've seen more than my share. Having developed rather an insatiable interest in the genre lately, I've been watching quite a few of them. I've watched all the classic Batman and Superman movies. I sought out the current mainstream superhero titles, even the ones I'd never really given any thought to before, or had any kind of investment in their characters or story lines. And I even watched a number of direct-to-video animated films on Netflix, some of which were surprisingly good, and others of which should be used as punishment for inmates at Arkham.So I've become pretty familiar with the genre. But Dark Knight was a whole other ballpark. Not for the story or the effects or the various elements of the comic books that they managed to work in or for any of the other million reasons why people might like or dislike a superhero movie. This movie is incredible, not just for what's in it, but moreso for the philosophy that's behind it.One of the goals of this "re-imagining" of the Batman saga was to make it seem more realistic. In Batman Begins, they accomplished this mainly with the design of the gadgets and technology, such as making the Batmobile look like a cross between an armoured car and a monster truck. Dark Knight prefers to focus more on characters and philosophy in this respect, and in so doing, gives us a re-imagining of not just of Batman, but of the very battle of Good vs. Evil. It poses questions like: How do you fight a villain you can't even understand? How far do you go to stop him? And who are the real heroes and villains when times are at their most desperate? Is there even a difference? Some of the answers to these questions are provided in the movie. Others are not so straightforward. You could write a book about all the moral and philosophical issues presented in this movie. In fact, someone already has.Of course, if you're not into the whole philosophical treatise thing, not to worry. This movie is still one heck of a thrill ride from beginning to end. There's explosions, car chases, high-tech gizmos, and diabolical games of cat-and-mouse. But underneath all the action, all the effects, all the excitement, is this one fascinating and harrowing concept: Some men just want to watch the world burn."

My movie's based on old comic books and is set in a fictional city. In it, there's going to be a rich guy who goes around fighting crime while dressed like a bat because his parents died. And then there's going to be this other guy who, for no given reason, dresses up like a clown, acts creepy, and goes around killing people. The bat dressing person is going to go around trying to defeat him by beating people up with his bare hands. Meanwhile, there's this other guy who's a perfectly nice lawyer, but then his face gets burned, so he decides to kill people based on this random coin that he has." It sounds kind of funny and interesting to you, but just as you're accepting it, the person suddenly coughs under his breath, "Oh yeah. And I'm going to take it seriously like it was Shakespeare and make it so depressing that it actively hurts the audience." I'm not sure if that's exactly how the meeting proposing this movie went, but it seems to be a reasonable guess. Let's face it. The whole story of this movie is patently ridiculous. It could not be more unrealistic if there were space aliens involved. And yet, it's still treated here as if we should be taking it as a serious parable of modern life, and that it should be used as a way to push really depressing messages across. How does a guy who beats people up while in a bat suit teach us about what kind of justice is realistic and effective? What does a weirdo in a clown suit teach us about the nature of evil?"

Here director Christopher Nolan injects some venom so to speak, in the form of the dark knight's nemesis, the villain, the Joker. All former characters, apart from the deceased make an appearance including Gordon (Oldman) who takes a twisted turn of fate, he becomes more involved in Batman's dealing with the help of Harvey Dent, whom all form part of a trio of do-gooders. Whereas Harvey (Eckhart) seems reluctant to follow the Dark Knight's methods, his incredulity still lingers, but eventually his short lived morale takes a starling one-hundred and eighty degree spin when the Joker gives him a few home- truths; in drag, you'll understand later.Everyone is wondering how well does Heath Ledger's portrayal rival that of the comic books interpretation, of which had help with novelists like Frank Miller on 'The Dark Knight Returns' and Alan Moore's 'The Killing Joke' which are renounced as some of the best comic books in existence, and of whom Nolan and Nolan took their source material. Truth is it goes beyond physical and metaphysical interpretation; Heath gives an amazingly profound performance of which will have lint lickers and comic book nerds in withdrawal twitters. The Joker is badass, to quote our American neighbours. He is the most likable unlikable out there on screen, true to that fact that Nolan's direction and Ledgers acting go hand in hand to produce a monumental performance. He does steal the show, as much as Batman; and he should, all fans and readers have been waiting for a performance of one of the most depraving maniacal villains to make a re-appearance. He plays the sides with sporadic sense of humour, and punches his way in like of a force of f'cking nature. His quick wit, cynicism, depravity and humour all provide a catalyst to this amazing roller-coaster ride of 152 minutes of amazingly executed action scenes that work well because of the fact they integrate into the plot as plot rather plot devices, the characters make the plot, even if it leads to hospitals being blown up. Maggie Gyllenhaal has made the replacement of Katie Holmes-Cruise character as Rachel Dawes, all we know is that Mrs Cruise was not interested in playing the part as she seems to be too busy playing Tom Cruise's wife. Watching Gyllenhaal, she makes the character wholesome and the fact that she bears a resemblance to the former actor of the character is merely of consequence, she also happens to play the love interest of both Batman and Harvey Dent (Eckhart); whom all know makes the brutal transformation to Two-Face. Interesting to note that Gyllenhaal happens to bring a stronger personality of the Dawes character and serves up her own moral compass when the revelation comes that Batman will one day retire to the likes of people like Harvey Dent, whom provides as much justice with a face as Batman whom wears a mask.All in all this is startlingly action-stocked blockbuster with a hysterically twisted sense of villainy, with the lines of good and evil blurred to unrecognisable locality. Verdict:Summer's here and so is Batman, course the Joker gets his share, the bigger half. Watch out for the magical disappearing  pencil trick. 10/10."

The Joker (Heath Ledger) is stealing from the bank where the mob keeps it's money. It bores him. He wants to do something that makes an impression.Meanwhile, Gotham City has a new District Attory. His name is Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart). Thanks to him (as well as Lt. James Gordon and Batman) the mob is falling apart. As you can imagine they are desperate. Who do they turn to for help? The Joker. However, The Joker does not care about helping the mob at all. He just sees it as a way to go through with his plan. What's his plan? To prove that people aren't good. To prove that everyone is, well, like him. He even forces Batman (Christian Bale) to question his own moral code. Will Joker prove his point or will Batman have another victory? Overall, the movie is great. The best movie of the year so far. Director Christopher Nolan makes a large amount of improvements over Batman Begins. Everything from pace to the fighting scenes. It's a movie a lot of people will enjoy. Even those who aren't a fan of the genre because this isn't your typical comic book adaptation. Nolan tries his best to make everything feel and look realistic. Which also hurts the movie if you're a fan of movies that do have the look and feel of a comic. Nonetheless, it's great for what it is. As for Ledger, he's fantastic. He does deserve an Oscar nomination as well as other people involved with this movie."

But some flaws","I was impressed with this new Batman film...I found the first installment, Batman Begins, to be quite average but this film blew that one out of the water. The storyline was well crafted, some great work by the DoP and jaw dropping action scenes. I tip my hat to the Nolan brothers for creating the sequence that plays out on the two boats - spectacularly creative.Everybody is talking about Ledger's brilliant performance as the Joker and these accolades are well deserved; he delivers here. Comparisons are not always the best tool for analysis, but I didn't believe it possible that someone could pull off a better Batman villain than Jack Nicholson. Congrats Mr. Ledger.I am surprised to see the film listed as #1 on IMDb however, and I think this rating will drop over time. The film is much too long and this is reflective, with respect, of several creative choices by the Nolans. The Harvey Dent character was poorly developed and his transformation threw the pace and rhythm of the film into a deep chasm.This cut-off the film's otherwise energetic flow as the Director ends up cutting away from the film's true gem (Ledger's Joker) far too often; dulling the suspense. I felt like I was watching an entirely new film/story! Different creative choices, should have allowed for more focus on the film's primary villain, the Joker, while setting up the third installment of the new Batman films (to appease the film's financiers now rolling in cash!) No doubt the scriptwriter was quite in love with the Joker; hence he has the best lines and scenes in the film. Bale/Batman seems to be taken over completely; not because he is a weak actor but because the Protagonist of this film is the Joker not Batman. I recognize the film deals with the Joker out-witting and psychologically torturing Batman, but did Batman have to sound so cheesy!? Batman's dialogue, particularly in response to Joker's antics, was clichéd and painful to the ear. I won't comment on how lame Batman's 'voice' came across! I know I am typically critical of most film's but I still found this well worth the watch. The CGI and action are spectacular, but battle/chase sequences are too difficult to adequately follow for average viewers."

I fcuking loved it and let me say that I only became a Batman fan after Batman Begins, which was also my first Batman movie. Nolan is truly a great director and will be considered one of the best by the time he's done. The storyline was great and the way everything was set up, I was never bored. It was great to see the internal struggle of Batman throughout the movie while the Joker is creating chaos throughout Gotham City. The action scenes were a blast and the chase scene was definitely the best. The ending was great and definitely has me pumped for the next movie. If Nolan and his brother team up for every movie from now on, I'll definitely be there to watch them.The acting was terrific. Christian Bale is back and great like last time. Katie Holmes has been replaced by Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel Dawes and she does a much better job than Katie Holmes. Aaron Eckhart is slowly becoming one of my favorite actors and he does not disappoint. Gary Oldman is back to play Jim Gordon and the veteran actor does a great job. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are back and they play their parts just right. I hope Michael Caine sticks around for the next Batman movie because he's great.Heath Ledger deserves a paragraph. Not just because of his untimely death, but because his last finished role is amazing. He has created quite possibly one of the best if not THE best villain of all time. He plays The Joker perfectly. The Joker is definitely playful but also incredibly dangerous. His lines are great and Heath delivers them perfectly. Heath did everything to make The Joker a great villain - the voice,the laugh, the idea of him looking like Alex from A Clockwork Orange. He truly looks scary and I would probably be afraid of him if I was a little kid. He definitely deserves a posthumous Oscar. This is the role that everyone will remember him for, more because it was his last role, but also because it was his greatest. RIP I would definitely recommend this movie because I feel like going back to the theaters to watch it again and very few movies have had that effect. The best movie so far and possibly of the year. It is now in my top 10 favorite movies - 10/10"

Gone are the cartoony colors, the cheesy villains, the bat nipples. The Dark Knight is just that, Dark. in fact, it I have only one criticism it would be that it isn't pretty enough. The photography is gritty, and dark and lit with cold lighting. But its effective. Speaking of awards, Heath Ledger deserves an Academy Award for his re-invention of The Joker. It's really tragic that he won't be around to enjoy the fruits of his labor. This movie will propel him to cult status. His Joker is demented. Twisted. Outright evil. I loved how he made a pencil disappear in his introduction scene. You'll understand when you see it. And you'll love the stories he comes up with on "how he got those scars." Another award should be given for the "makeup" on Two Face. Although it isn't makeup, it's the most horrific and haunting face you will ever see. Very ghastly, yet again, very effective. The movie does an amazing job of telling of his downward spiral. It is long, at 2 hours and 30 minutes, but it does leave you wanting more. (in a good way). It's really two movies in one. At one point when you think things are winding down to a finale, it's just getting warmed up. And when it is finally over, it isn't. There WILL be a sequel. And I'm in line already to see it."

Though now, just recently giving it a watch for the second time, it really isn't no masterpiece. I think everybody loved the movie so much is because of Heath's fantastic performance as the villain Joker, and the sudden, shocking death of Heath Ledger. But, watching it for the second time on your normal size television, and with all the hype and high standards dead; it's no masterpiece. Chris Bale hardly to what it felt like put in any effort, god he really can't play Batman and it felt like just another one of those superhero movies (apart from Heath's stunning performance).

9,28-Jul-08,TheFluffyKnight,2,5,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"The Dark Knight","A retrospective look illuminates a not wholly unsurprising parallel between the progress of the comic book film, and that of the comics industry itself. From highly successful beginnings in the Superman and Batman franchises, the comic book film moved into less auspicious territory in the 1990s, what with juvenile monstrosities like Captain America, The Phantom, and Batman and Robin  an era not dissimilar to the similarly juvenile comics of the 1950s and '60s.Then, like the '70s, in which some welcome maturity was injected into comics, the late '90s and 2000s saw a boom in more grown-up and technically accomplished comic book films, such as Blade, Hellboy, and the X-Men and Spider-Man series. But something else was started with Batman Begins, Christopher Nolan's sombre reboot of the Batman franchise. Something akin to Alan Moore and Frank Miller's revitalisation of comics in the '80s. Something that has come to full fruition with Nolan's follow-up to Begins, The Dark Knight. Yes, The Dark Knight may just be the Watchmen of comic book films.The film picks up at an unspecified, but assumedly brief time after Begins, with Batman (Christian Bale) continuing his crusade against a weakened and desperate mob. In an early scene, he apprehends a somewhat unhinged Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy), now reduced to peddling his fear toxin to Gotham's drug dealers. The Caped Crusader is "assisted" by a gang of Batman wannabes - a positive but unwanted sign that Gotham's citizens are being inspired by Batman's example.But Batman believes that the time is coming when Bruce Wayne can hang up cape and cowl and call it a day. He hopes to pass the beacon of hope on to chiselled District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart). Dent is a man not afraid to go that extra mile in the fight against crime; at one point he manages to convict over five hundred criminals at once.Of course, it's not long before a wrench is thrown into the gears. A wrench in the shape of a scarred sociopathic madman known only as the Joker (Heath Ledger). Adorned in a purple suit, white make-up, and a red rictus grin, the Joker first manages to once again unite the mob, then has the citizens of Gotham cowering in terror from his reign of pure chaos.Posthumous Oscar nomination aside, Ledger's performance is a dark and sometimes disturbing gem that deserves every bit of praise that it's getting. The heavy make-up that obscures the actor's face is only an exterior symbol of the extent to which Ledger fearlessly dives into the Joker's psyche. The young man who charmed his way through A Knight's Tale, and mumbled his way through Brokeback Mountain, is nowhere to be seen.Instead, Ledger licks his lips, moves with an edgy, unpredictable grace, and snaps from comical to creepy in the blink of an eye. He spreads disorder throughout Gotham, taking character's moral codes and twisting them into impossible situations. As the Joker says himself, "The only sensible way to live in this world is without rules." But, contrary to recent press coverage, this is not solely Ledger's show. Christian Bale, returning to the Batsuit, is just as good as Bruce Wayne/Batman as he was in Begins, if not better. He is not as tormented as in the previous film, having found in Batman a effective outlet for his anger and grief; but he still smoulders with the intensity required to make this difficult character believable. Gary Oldman also stands out, having a much more significant role this time around; Lt. James Gordon seems to occupy the moral middle-ground between Batman and Harvey Dent, two characters prepared to bend, and maybe even break the rules in their pursuit of justice.The film's supporting roles are also above par. Michael Caine's fabulously dry Alfred adds some welcome humour into the otherwise totally bleak proceedings. Morgan Freeman continues to exude class as Lucius Fox. And Maggie Gyllenhaal's spunky Rachel Dawes is vast improvement over Katie Holmes' ingratiating version of the seemingly superfluous character (Dawes is much more important this time around).The narrative drive of The Dark Knight, however, belongs to Dent. Eckhart is perfect in the role. He has the charisma and integrity to pull off the crusading D.A., and the pathos and emotion to make his descent into the vengeful Two-Face a truly tragic turn of events. And when it comes to the all important scarringwell, Tommy ain't got nothing on this.Other directors might have treated all of this as nothing more than popcorn entertainment. But not Christopher Nolan. Right from the opening shots, Nolan declares that The Dark Knight is not just a comic book film, not even a sophisticated comic book film; but rather a sophisticated crime drama. The neo-noir visuals, the dark urban settings (shot masterfully by cinematographer Wally Pfister), and the carefully staged action sequences could more easily have come from something akin to Heat or Se7en as a summer blockbuster.It seems strange comparing a Batman film to cinema's great crime sagas, but there is no way around it. Nolan and his brother Johnathan have written a perfectly crafted thriller that uses its otherwise outlandish characters to explore the very nature of morality, and especially that nature in terms of our governments' war on terror. One of Batman's tools will certainly spark debate concerning our progressively more pervasive surveillance culture. And when was the last time a comic book film sparked any kind of serious debate?I said at the beginning of this review that The Dark Knight is the Watchmen of comic book films. I can think of no better way of putting it. Alan Moore's graphic novel showed readers that comics can be dark, complex, and intelligent. Similarly, The Dark Knight will prove to audiences that comic book films aren't just mindless flashy entertainment; they can engage us, explore the very nature of humanity. And most importantly, they can make us think."

There was plenty of non-stop action to keep everyone entertained but the thing I think stole the show was Heath Ledgers performance as The Joker. Though I don't want to say it, Heath did such a great job, his Joker surpassed that of Jack Nicholson. He made the Joker darker, scary, and well thought of. This Joker rivals the evil of Hannibal Lecter. This was by far the best superhero movie I've ever seen. All in all, an Oscar winning performance from Heath, and this movie certainly deserves AT LEAST a nomination for best picture. Many will say that it probably won't get best picture, just do to the fact that it's a superhero movie. They're wrong. Go see The Dark Knight everyone, and you'll see what i'm talking about."

This movie was INCREDIBLE!!!!! It kept you going the whole way through - and if it wasn't the action it was the AWESOME job of the actors throughout the movie that made it GREAT!!!!! I was incredibly worried about all the hype before the movie came out. The hype is blown away with actually seeing the film......Heath Ledger's performance was OUTSTANDING........he created this absolute villain that had strewn chaos and violence throughout the film.... including the humor that came at the right times...... I am truly sad that he is not here to see how well he did and how others have raved about his role in this film.....But the other person in this film that I felt did an excellent job was Gary Oldman as Commissioner Gordon....... God he was great..... while others were breaking down he stood the quiet hero..... Gary Oldman was awesome!!!! Every part played was very well performed........How could they not rave about everyone in this movie???? Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine... Aaron Eckhardt another outstanding performance as well.I admit that I saw Batman for Heath Ledger...... The news of his death in January threw me off knowing that he was young and had a lot more he could give..... I waited and watched trailers to see his performance and he was outstanding......it out shined the talk and hype seeing this movie.I honestly feel that this movie is the Best with all forms of emotion coming out - anger, sadness, humor, lightheartedness, fear, anxiety, happiness even (yes, it does come out), and all the while you watch with the utmost anticipation.I went twice this opening weekend and the theater was full each time and when the movie started, you could hear a needle drop, well in between all the action that is all the way to the end. It felt as though you were the only one there that's how quiet it was, and that shows a good movie. People also clapped and yahooed when Heath Ledger's name appeared and when Commissioner Gordon reappears in the movie and that was FANTASTIC!!!!! Not often have I seen this.To all that made the movie, it was EXCELLENT. If I have forgotten anything, I apologize. Along with everyone else, this was just a GREAT movie and it very well deserves all nods for awards, and Gary Oldman justly deserves recognition as well as Heath Ledger, they were GREAT!!!! Thank You."

The primary actors in this film should be ashamed of their performances in this picture. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine are two of the finest actors in the business. These men are generally the gold standard in their profession, however in The Dark Knight, they allow the horrible script and direction drag them to lows I never thought possible. This picture is a great example of poor story telling and bad direction.The editing was horrible and the "special effects" were childish, even the photography was weak. Yeah, we get the gray tones and the urban hues... but please, enough already. The story was confusing, there was no one to like (even Batman), no plot, too many explosions, too much repetition, horrible dialog and a weak, unsatisfying ending.So, what made this movie successful? Four things. The Batman brand. Marketing. Marketing. Marketing.Geez, this was just so disappointing."

The 9 year old sitting next to me was literally crying to his dad to leave. He eventually fell asleep.Once again another Batman movie comes out after all the hoopla and cool looking imagery and all I get is a very overlong, humorless movie filled with monologues on what makes men go bat crap crazy. Once again Batman gets lost in the shuffle of too many characters, too many villains, convoluted storyline, and too little screen time. Of course movies should come with a plot but they should be entertaining as well. And the plot just wasn't very interesting in itself. The movie exclaims Gotham, Gotham, Gotham, but you never get a sense of life in the city. You're supposed to believe that Gotham is overrun by criminals because they pack all of the 'crimelords' into one room where they basically say "we're running this city". Then they pack all the cops and Batman into a room where they basically say "we can't let them run the city" and that's basically it.Where was the action? There were so many scenes of talk, talk, talk that when the action began to happen I remembered I was watching a 'supposedly' superhero action movie. And before you knew it, the scene was over and we were back to watching Bruce Wayne watch the news on TV. There was really no definitive, memorable action sequence. Although I will say that the editing during the Bat bike scenes was 'cut' much better than the Batmobile scene in Batman Begins. You actually get to view extended shots of the bike and appreciate how cool it looks before it cuts away.I did not like the technique of playing multiple scenes with various characters simultaneously building up to some sort of mini climax. It works well when you use it once maybe. Not throughout most of the movie. It felt like watching a trailer. Heath Ledger (r.i.p.) was very good. Ackhart was just as good. Maggie Gyllenhal does a very good impersonation of Katie Holmes playing Rachel. In fact, the whole cast was excellent. But where was Christian Bale? There were just too many shots of Bale sitting and staring at something. The sea, the TV, the city, the TV, his Bat suit. All in all I was disappointed with this over long, self important, humorless summer blockbuster. My kid summed it up on the way home saying how he felt the movie was made for 'fortysomething' fans of the graphic novels. And he's right. The movie won't disappoint that crowd. But if you're not in that crowd, you might feel a little out of place."

It has amazing pace, editing, cinematography and acting. It goes without saying that after seeing his performance as the Joker, Keith Ledger's death will only be mourned more, for his role in this movie was superb. I did however feel that this movie is more about The Joker than Batman. Somehow his presence and role in the film is richer than Batman's role. Nonetheless there is a true dark comic book grittiness in this movie that did not exist in any of the others at this level. The violence is marked and hard to shake off. Disturbing would be the best way to describe it, heightening the feeling of terror that The Joker delivers. When he enters the scene, the tension rises. Cristopher Nolan is a great director!"

And this movie was way to long, the scenes were either to long or to short and left a lot of questions to be answered.If you're a Batman fan, i would pass on this flop, you will be disappointed like i was.I don't know about the rest of you people out there, but i think these directors who make these Batman films should read the comics and watch the old Batman shows before they make a movie.In my opinion, i haven't seen one decent Batman movie yet, the only one that was entertaining to me was the one with Jim carrey as the riddler, the rest of them have all been lousy in my opinion"

Sign in to vote.,"The golden-standard for all comic-book movies","4/4 ESSENTIALThis 2008 rendition of Batman became an instant classic, and drew many cult fans. It's prequel, Batman Begins (2005) was fairly weak in comparison, but it set the stage for one of the most controversial and critically acclaimed movies ever made: The Dark Knight.This movie is a definite stretch from its predecessor, starring Michael Keaton as Batman and Jack Nicholson as The Joker. Not only was it performed differently, the cast and crew took an entirely different approach to the making of The Dark Knight. One is meant to provide comic relief, with (in Tim Burton tradition) very spruced up, "avant-garde" sets and vivid color. The other is meant to tell the tale of a psychological nightmare in Christopher Nolan's gritty, lurid, and bleak fashion. On a personal note: The Dark Knight is not only far superior to the 1989 version, it is among my favorite movies of all time. (Rated 10 Stars on IMDb)There is a very sick charm this movie has, Heath Ledger. Much like Batman did with Jack Nicholson, The Dark Knight is made by the role of The Joker. Ledger's Joker is a very special villain in today's cinema, as he makes no efforts whatsoever to redeem himself. He is not looking for pity (as his past is obscured in this movie), all he wants is to see you suffer. This is one of the most enjoyable elements of the film, as Ledger's emphasizing The Joker's psychology as opposed to his origins. Character development is a prevalent theme, yet the writers were very cautious to keep the characters relatively 2-Dimensional.Eckhart's Two-Face is The Dark Knight's second freshest face on the set. Over the course of the movie, you watch an ultimately very likable character lose everything he ever loved. Eckhart really delved deep into his dual-personalities, and was characterized as hating, tender, destroyed, strong, fixed, and broken. Christian Bale playing the lead role as Batman also showed signs of emptiness throughout, as someone who was coping with loss and suffering from the The Joker's mind-games, and being crushed under the weight of an unthankful Gotham. This battle of the mind effects the already dark mood of the movie, and adds the temporary flavor of hopelessness. As an evaluation of Bale's performance, I would say he greatly improved on his already powerful character from Batman Begins, taking his dramatic effects to a whole new level.Also, Christopher Nolan creates a dystopian Gotham that rivals any competition. He creates a culture in the city that feels strangely disunited yet in harmony, where the good transcends the evil. This happens much in the same way the characters interact.Every superhero movie I ever see will be compared to The Dark Knight. It's complexity will not go unnoticed and many will try to rival it. Some may watch this movie purely for action and entertainment, but if you look an inch or two deeper... you'll also see a master work of art."

9,20-Jul-08,giesen_public,5,13,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"Reality Check","Why do I feel reluctant to give this movie a rating of 7 stars out of 10? The average rating on this web site has this movie rated the highest of any movie ever made. I walked out of the theater yesterday evening with the feeling that I had seen one of (yes, I said "one of") the best action movies ever made. But I couldn't shake the feeling that I had just watched just another installment of a new, dark interpretation of a beloved comic book hero.The truth is, it took so long for the action to really start rolling that my ten-year-old son had fallen fast asleep watching his favorite kind of movie (yet he had seen the attention-grabbing scene where the Joker met the mob bosses and it was still only about 5:30). Once it got going, it got going like few others (and yes, I woke my boy once I knew it would keep his interest).I think that the director worked so diligently at making the mood of the movie fit the hero's adjective in its title ("Dark"), that it worked against it in the slow spots. Almost EVERYthing about this movie seemed dark. The darkness is so pervasive that even when good things happened, they felt more like a brief relief than something to be happy about.Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker -- aided, in no small part, by the script -- gave us a disturbing fiend. I managed a few chuckles at the character, but no real laughs. This Joker wasn't really very funny to me because I felt that an attempt was made to portray him a bit more as a "real" person with a severe psychological problem than the over-the-top comic book character that Jack Nicholson gave us. I find it hard to laugh at someone with real (or realistic) problems. (Had I wanted realism, I wouldn't have looked for it in a comic book-hero movie.) We found out, early on, that this Joker was severely twisted, and bad things happened with enough regularity that nothing he did really surprised me. There were some quality scenes, but the director seems to have favored quantity. I thought that more could have been made of some scenes, but the point eventually came where so much had thrown at us that I found myself simply sighing in anticipation of Batman putting the Joker out of our misery. As for the rest of the main cast... Christian Bale, to me, is serviceable in the role, but not quite believable as Bruce Wayne. Bale is "cool" in the role, but a man accustomed to Bruce Wayne's kind of wealth would have an ease about him that didn't come through in this performance. If they were shooting for realism in the Joker's psyche, they should have been aiming for it here, too. (As for Batman, any of a number of actors in that costume with the voice disguiser would have seemed the same.) Also, I saw no real chemistry between him and his love interest, played by Maggie Gyllenhaal. Nor did I see any sparks fly between her and her other love interest, played by Aaron Eckhart. Otherwise, Eckhart was quite good as Harvey Dent/Two-Face, I thought. I think that the rest of the cast did alright in their roles. Two worth mentioning in particular were Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman -- not for their outstanding work so much as for the vanilla lines they were given. They did fine jobs with what they were given, but what a waste of talent...Okay, so I've laid out most of what I didn't like about the movie. What I did like about it was that it did have some great action sequences and special effects. Joker plays a "social experiment" and a variety of other mind games that keep the story interesting in forcing difficult decisions on other characters. That's about it, really, but those things are done exceedingly well. I didn't really care for the pervasive darkness in the atmosphere and mood of many of the characters, but if that's what the director, cast, and crew were shooting for, they did that exceedingly well, too.Personally, I'm ready to rent the 1989 version of Batman with Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson. I remember feeling more entertained when I walked out of the theater after seeing that one for the first time than I did yesterday."

This superb action thriller is worth every cent of the gigantic screen. And the crystal clear resolution of the IMAX shots is astonishing. You can see through the windows of the well lit skyscrapers! One warning though: There are certain action scenes that might appear too busy on the screen for some viewers to capture entirely; after all, it's an eight-story tall screen. But it's OK to lose a little bit of details because most likely you'll want to watch the movie again. The two 70+ legendary actors are just amazing. Michael Caine said that he had all the funny lines at the London premiere, and he's absolutely right. He adds humor and wisdom to this dark film. Morgan Freeman plays the elegant scientist so well, and his subtle facial expression seems to tell people: I know what you're thinking; I know it all. Maggie Gyllenhaal did quite well, much better than Katie Holms. But she failed to convey the struggle in choosing between 2 men. But perhaps Nolan's idea of Rachel isn't a woman with strong emotions. She is an old friend of Bruce's, best friend since childhood. She admires Bruce for what he sacrifices (his normal life) to save Gotham. But she might never have loved him. She made it clear that life with dual identity wasn't the kind she wanted Bruce to lead. She didn't commit anything to him at the end of "The Batman Begins" except an ambiguous promise. So maybe we have to factor this in when we judge Maggie's performance.Christian Bale, our leading man, is very convincing in portraying a hero with moral burdens. He once said that he didn't have to act Batman's rage because of the headache caused by the tight mask. I can't say that he has "acted" well this time because it seems to me that he didn't have to act again given his recent news. Whether that's true or not, he is the best incarnation of Bruce Wayne / Batman, and I hope Nolan will write Christian a bigger part that lives up to its name in the 3rd installment, which I'm very much looking forward to. Overall, this is a movie that I don't regret seeing 3 times in theaters. Every time I got something new out of it. If you have the patience to watch a movie over 150 minutes, TDK is definitely the best choice of this summer. "The next most anticipated film" submitted on July 28th The Dark Knight is a movie worth seeing at least twice. No wonder it's breaking one record after another in the box office.The first time around, you'll be thrilled as you ride the roller coaster with many unexpected turns. Director Christopher Nolan has created such a suspense atmosphere that throughout the movie, you'll keep wondering what's next and you can't help guessing but you won't guess them all as the film is full of surprises. The awe-inspiring music, the spectacular skyscrapers of both Gotham and Hong Kong, the racing and flipping of cars and trucks, and the swift switches between scenes of simultaneous events which Nolan is famous for as his intriguing way of storytelling, all and all drive your adrenaline level high and heart beating fast; it leaves you little space to fully appreciate the wonderful acting of every actor. Except, of course, you'll be immediately overwhelmed by Heath Ledger's unprecedented and unsurpassable performance as the Joker. His portrayal will leave a long lasting impression in every viewer, fan of his or not.That's why you should see it again. This time, with the storyline in mind, you can relax while watching and you'll find that literally EVERY major actor, Christian Bale, Gary Oldman, Aaron Eckhart, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Maggie Gyllenhaal has done a superb job playing his / her character. Even those who play smaller roles deliver. Maybe the baleheads will find Christian not being seen enough in his titular movie, and that's probably the only small disappointment in this film for them. The real disappointment, and pity, in reality, is the death of Heath. Toward the end of the movie, you'll already start expecting the 3rd installment in which the 2 uncompromising enemies continue their entangled fight. But that's difficult to fulfill now because finding a replacement to play the Joker for the late actor is almost impossible (I personally think it's impossible, but let's give many talented young actors out there the benefit of the doubt). Whoever dares take this challenge is admirable and will be under tons of pressure trying to meet such a high benchmark, let alone exceeding it.The huge success of the film deserves celebrations, but hopefully it won't become a burden for Nolan and Bale and thus delay the next sequel, which will be the next most anticipated film. Setting high standards for themselves, they won't settle for something that doesn't surpass the Dark Knight. The long waiting process begins.Edited on August 4thTo answer Mr. Alex Billington's question whether TDK will beat Titanic, I think it's possible. This movie is my only one to see in theaters twice. And I've been invited to see the IMAX version by the friend who accompanied me to see it the second time. At first she questioned why I needed to see it twice, but now she's more fascinated than me. TDK has altered my personal movie-viewing habit and set the record as the only film that I believe I'll ever see 3 times in theaters. With the lackluster performance of the third Mummy, and no other major blockbusters opening this weekend, TDK may keep its reign for 4 weekends in a row. Even if TDK doesn't outsell Titanic in the box office, I predict it will on DVD."

He was a Ninja, that was one of the secrets to his effectiveness combating crime.Alas, in the sequel, "The Dark Knight", Batman lost the Ninja skills and became a brawler. The only "ninja" thing he still does is the little disappearing thing when someone turns away for a moment.A case in point is the battle at the Taiwan skyscraper. I've seen those moves in WWF and the fisticuffs punching was used in the 1960s cowboy movies. Would a ninja hold an opponent up with one hand then draw the other arm way back to give a rockum sockem kaplow? Note that he was under attack by many foes at the time. Maybe I missed something and that was a homage to the 1960s Batman TV show.Other then this and the silly large wheels on the car, (won't they be very vulnerable?), the movie was not too bad.-- Me"

But after a while I came around to loving Ledger's Joker!But having said all this, there in an uncomfortable grim feeling to watching the film today as most of us now know what Ledger went through to make this film role so good. This is the second Nolan Batman movie, the first one was just as good as this but the third one was very hit and miss. However, all three movies must be seen and enjoyed."

If you remember in the first one at the end police man Gordon handed him the joker card saying there's a new bad guy on the loose. So this movie is all about the joker (Heath Ledger)and his attempt to get control of the city by taking down all the rival gangs and eventually batman himself.This movie is just awesome.

And it is safe to say that is surpassed ALL expectations.I will not be giving anything away, so there is no need for a spoiler alert to those of you that haven't seen it.This movie was and is one of the greatest movies of all time. When you watch it, you don't feel like you're watching a comic book, but you are instead watching a crime epic like Heat or The Departed.Christian Bale plays both a convincing Bruce Wayne and the Dark Knight himself, Batman. He brings this character to a new level that far surpasses any other Batman, be it Michael Keaton in Batman '89 and Batman Returns, Val Kilmer in Batman Forever (my personal favorite out of the Burton/Schumacher films), and George Clooney in Batman & Robin (by far the worst Batman/Bruce Wayne in all 7 installments of the live action Batman franchise --yes, even worse than Adam West). Bale was far superior in The Dark Knight, than even his outstanding performance in Batman Begins.Maggie Gyllenhaal was an upgrade from Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes, the original actress to play the love interest of Bruce Wayne in Batman Begins. In the Dark Knight as she takes on the difficult love triangle between Bruce, herself, and Harvey Dent --the new district attorney.Aaron Eckhart was perfect for the role of Harvey Dent, a.k.a., Two-Face. You'll have to see him for yourselves, to understand his true volatile nature, and why he was so perfect for this role.Others who reprised their roles from Batman Begins, Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, Gary Oldman as Lt. Jim Gordon, and Michael Caine as Bruce Wayne's loyal butler, Alfred, are once again outstanding. And everyone from Eric Roberts to Michael Jai White, to Monique Curnen was great in his or her roles as well.And last, but definitely not least, the one who stole the show, Heath Ledger as the vile and twisted JOKER. The Late actor gave us one of the most memorable movie characters of all time, not to mention one of the best portrayals of a villain, which greatly challenges other great villains from Hannibal Lecter to Darth Vader. Heath's performance touches you in a way that has you leave the theater shaking. As you watch him, he constantly surprises you, and everything he does makes you glad that he was chosen for this role. His performance far surpasses that of Jack Nicholson's Joker in Batman '89.It is not only wrong to assume that this brilliantly played role, perfectly executed by the late Heath Ledger, is what led to his sad and untimely death, but it is also extremely insulting, both to Ledger's talent as an actor, and credibility as a person. Shame on everyone who assumes such a thing.If he does not get at least a best supporting actor nomination for an academy award, I would like to see the performance that beats his. And if he did actually win an academy award for his performance, it wouldn't be a sympathy win, he really truly deserves a win, or at least a nomination. Even Michael Caine was suggesting Ledger's performance Oscar-worthy, even before Ledger passed away. Now, the whole cast is backing that suggestion up.I say the same, that this movie at least deserves a Best Picture win or at least a nomination. I don't say this because I am a die-hard Batman fan, but I say this because this is one of the greatest movies of the to ever make it's way to the big screen. Not only is this possibly the greatest comic book/ Superhero movie of all time, but it's possibly one of the greatest movies ever MADE.It was and still is a MASTERPIECE. A masterpiece in story, character development, visual effects, cinematography, MUSIC, and anything else you can name. It was the fastest 2 hrs and 45 min of my life. Not once did I look at my watch and say, "Man, when does this end, it's 2:00 AM!" The midnight showing was awesome! But hey, don't take my word for it. Go see it for yourself. It's going to be in theaters for a long time. All I can tell you is, expect the unexpected.I'll close with one word of advice. Try and see this as many times as you can before it leaves the theaters. I've seen it thrice!"

I had seen the TV series  that was fun as a boy. I could not see Batman Begins  which I hear was really good. The hype around this release was so huge; reviews over the top and IMDb rating  topped it all. Number 1 spot of all time great ratings. Need I wait any longer? Movie starts with Joker (Heath Ledger) robbing a bank, following by Batman (Christian Bale) catching bad guys; and Joker telling the bad guys  KILL THE BATMAN. Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is like super hero attorney of the city. Joker takes it on himself to find and kill the Batman. To do that he creates havoc all around the city to bring Batman out in the open; but 90 minutes through the movie Batman catches Joker and puts him behind bars. (Curtains? You can just walk out of the movie hall at this stage  but another 1 hour of mayhem is yet to come) Joker escapes prison and creates more chaos and death all around. Due to the death of Harvey's girl friend Rachel (Maggie Gyllenhaal)  Harvey turns his guns on the cops of the city. Batman manages to catch Joker again, but to keep Harvey a hero forever - Batman takes on himself the crimes of Harvey. The movie ends with cops chasing Batman.The movie has a dark comic book feel about it. However, it is not a comic book stuff. The movie is gruesome, dark, and grim. The pace is racy, the acting brilliant, the script tight, the dialogues nerve wracking.All the actors have acted brilliantly, but the movie is over-powered by the powerful and scintillating performance of Heath Ledger as Joker. He sets the screen on fire, with his terrific performance and over-shadows all the other characters.The music by James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer matches the tempo of the movie, while the editing by Lee Smith of the movie is patchy and pathetic. The movie jumps from one scene to another in sharp fashion.But to assemble this huge comic book story in this dark and gruesome manner  credit should go to Director Christopher Nolan  who takes one step forward since Batman Begins. (His movie Prestige was below the big budget huge cinema) Christopher uses the entire big gimmick stuff that a movie can provide to make it a blockbuster. How I hoped that he had used better editing and more children friendly images.I enjoyed the movie  comic book in adult format.(Stars 7.5 out of 10)"

Sign in to vote.,"Brilliant adaptation","There is haunting poetry to the narrative and characterization of Christopher Nolan in "the Dark Knight". It refuses to be reduced to just another comic book movie with actors wearing costumes and good guys fighting the evil ones. It refuses to be limited to the defined caricatures that we have seen other adaptations to do. The Batman unlike most other superheroes is not bestowed with super natural powers. He is a human being who happens to gifted with will power, money and technology but also inherits the human weaknesses and moral ambiguities. Hence, it is the most relatable super hero from the audience perspective. Hardcore comic book fanatics of all ages pride themselves on reading between the words and beyond the costumes, of being able to assess the theological and mythological undertone to these "cartoonish" comic books. I suppose Chistopher and Jonathan Nolan are two of them.The film starts where Gotham is now under a strict vigil of the Batman. He has inspired fear among the thugs, smugglers, gangsters which has lead to an "escalation" of the battle for the city. This peculiar situation calls on a new kind of nemesis, one who is not drawn by money or power, one who can not beaten or toned down morally or ideologically, one who is driven by a certain philosophy "Anarchy", THE JOKER. In one of the performances that will define the genius of one of the short lived talents, Heath Ledger is the Joker. Nolan and Ledger play it smart by portraying Joker as an "absolute", without necessarily dissecting him. He is conniving, intelligent, driven and convincing which makes him doubly scary. The joker poses impossible moral, ethical and philosophical dilemmas to Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman), Batman and the people of Gotham city. It is a battle for the minds more than the city, battle of the good and evil within Batman who has his own demons.And then there is Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), Two face, who becomes a challenge, a personal project for the Joker, as an emblematic mean to propel his philosophy. The film has great dialogs that you would remember and keep thinking about even after you leave the theater. The screenplay is a bit rushed at times and story works on one too many tracks. The editing is bit shoddy at places. The Imax camera works brilliantly especially for the action sequences which are jaw dropping to say the least.Overall, this is film, that all of us will look back on, and say, finally they got it right."

9,18-Sep-16,stephenmarch,2,3,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"Disappointing","The Dark Knight has slick production value and impressive acting, but much of it is poorly paced and poorly written. It amazes me that a movie could at once be so stellar in terms of execution, yet so lackluster in terms of conception. I say this because it's apparent that many of the people involved in cinematography, costume, makeup, sound, special effects, editing, etc. did very good work, but no amount of talent could save such a weak script. There's really no reason to care about any of the characters, and I was actually bored throughout much of the movie. The Dark Knight masquerades as a high-quality crime drama, expertly manipulating the audience into thinking that it's going to be a good movie, to such an extent that many people have actually been tricked into believing that it is a great movie. The Dark Knight somehow never lives up to its hype. Despite the fact that many of the people who worked on this movie really tried to make it great, The Dark Knight's inability to reconcile its pretensions of sophistication with its silly, comic-book origins ultimately causes its reach to exceed its grasp."

Sign in to vote.,"The Dark Knight, incrementally better than previous movie","MOVIE REVIEW: BATMAN - THE DARK KNIGHTThe second installment of the new Batman franchise, begun with Batman Begins, picks up our story not long after where we left off. But I'm not going to talk about the plot of The Dark Knight, other than to say it starts with a bang involving a powerful scene augmented by pervasive music.All our favorites are backAlfred, played deliciously by Michael Caine is a delight to see in this role again. Dry, acerbic, witty and caring, Michael Caine is one of our generation's most dependable actors and again in this movie is a grounding influence on the young Master Bruce Wayne.Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox plays his sagacious and insightful role as both guardian of Wayne Enterprises and modern day "Q" as co-inventor of many Bat-machines. Morgan Freeman has been doing a lot of work recently including the comedy Bucket List with Jack Nicholson and the current Wanted with Angelina Jolie.Gary Oldman returns as Jim Gordon, now head of the Major Crimes Unit in a rather expanded role compared to the first Batman movie. He gets more room to work, and show off his "Gotham City" accent. How different from the proper British accent of Serious Black in the Harry Potter movies.Aaron Eckhart is given a significant role as Harvey Dent, white knight District Attorney and new love interest of Rachel. He's probably best known recently for his starring role in Thank You For Smoking.Christian Bale is back as the Dark Knight Detective, and though he plays the self-centered billionaire playboy well, he best shines as the Batman. Because there is not the exposition of the origin story as in the previous movie, he seems eclipsed in this film by the villain.Three new playersMaggie Gyllenhaal takes over from Katie Holmes in the role of Rachel Hawes. Not only is she beautiful, but she can act and is credible in the role. Katie Holmes had only personal pulchritude going for her, but not the acting chops, and she is not missed here. Katie came off as the "girl next door" who never matured. Here, with this film, Rachel is a mature woman, and the object of desire and conflict. You wished he had more to do in this movie.The criminal Salvatori Maroni is played by Eric Roberts, who we haven't seen much since his role in the TV series Heroes. He's mature, smooth, attractive, and the perfect gangland gentleman.But the real standout is Heath Ledger as the villain The Joker. He is virtually unrecognizable in this role, if you didn't already know who was playing the role. As the original villain in the first Batman comic in 1940, here he is the quintessential maniacal anarchist. Played more as an amoral terrorist than a loony, he brings a very different feel to this role than Jack Nickelson did in the debut run of the previous Batman series. No one does crazy like Jack, but Heath goes a very different direction. Jack could be funny, saying of Batman "Where does he get those marvelous toys?" Heath brings a menace to the screen that is palpable. From his first scene he's chilling, creepy.He achieves his art with three things, beyond the makeup:* His gait: he walks all spindly, like a marionette* His tongue: he licks his lips nervously, like Jabba the Hut* His voice: like many screen villains (think Darth Vader) he drops his voice into an almost gravelly monotone that seems like pure evil itself.There is already talk of an Oscar for this performance, and indeed, it is the magnum opus of his career. Some may see this movie just to see the last performance of this amazing talent. It is incredible what he's done with the part, making it all his own.The movieThe filming venues are interesting. While Gotham City is supposed to represent Manhattan Island, it is obvious that several locales in Chicago were used in this film, and indeed, Illinois saw $40 million pumped into its economy by this movie. But numerous shots of Hong Kong were also used, including the top of its tallest building, Two International Finance Centre.This film is an incremental level above the first: it's taut, immersive, moody, exciting and scary, all at once. At times it is mind blowing in its intensity, and stunning in its inventiveness. It opens to midnight debuts tonight across 1,700 theaters in the US. Some believe this could be this summer's first $100M opening weekend blockbuster.While the previous film had a confusing third act, this one has a series of smaller crescendos that build into a satisfying conclusion.This is a relentlessly intense movie. The fight scenes are more realistic, with less close in filming that would otherwise hide the martial arts. This is likely too intense for young viewers under 12.Grade: A-/B+You'll like it if: you like comics, sci-fi, action, detective storiesYou won't like it if: excessive violence and rampant insanity aren't your cup of teaBill Petro, your friendly neighborhood culture vulture www.billpetro.com"

Sign in to vote.,"The Dark Knight In Retrospect","I saw this film on its theatrical release after a 4 week wait with an advance ticket that I purchased, and it completely caught me off guard! In a great way! This film had so many twists and surprises than I could have ever imagined. And I clearly saw why many think that Ledger's performance is Oscar worthy. In my honest opinion, this film is the most believably realistic interpretation of a comic book movie that I have ever seen. Now, 1989's Batman will always appear to have nailed our expectations of how Batman & The Joker should translate onto celluloid, but there's something about The Dark Knight that made The Joker more of a frightening threat to Gotham as well as the perfect antagonist for Batman's honor towards law & justice. As I watched scenes in which The Joker was up to his deadly deeds, I could honestly feel a sense of eminent danger and just how dangerous of a threat that the sadistic "Clown Prince of Crime" was despite Batman's attempts to stop him. I feel that this film is clearly the best of all the Batman films, and is a close rival to 1989's Batman. I found each action scene highly exhilarating and smartly plotted. The Dark Knight makes DC a force to be reckoned with in its quest to out do the Marvel films.R.I.P., Heath Ledger."

To be honest, I was afraid it would be too scary- like horror movie scary, cause of the way the Joker was made to look in this one. And while it was creepy, it was not horror-creepy- and I'm glad of that. The Scarecrow in Batman Begins was much scarier (and I hated him- my least fave Batman bad guy yet!). I really liked the Joker in this one more than I thought I would, and Heath Ledger deserved all the hype he got for the role, may he R. I. P.With this, I have now seen all 3 Christopher Nolan Batman films, and while I didn't like the first or last ones, this one was a gem.

Sign in to vote.,"It's Art!","Swimming in the wake of so many preceding commentators, i still hope to point out few details which were left aside until now. Bytheway i've read every single comment on The Dark Knight posted on the IMDb.com. Well, it was fun, a serious one. This film i'd call pleiotropic, because of it works simultaneously on several levels, and it works good.Some miscellaneous notes on The Dark Knighton Batman's voice: since it's a fantasy, it should be performed with exaggerations, so i welcome Batman played by Christian Baleon Harvey Dent: Aaron Eckhart not only had a line about Gaius Julius Caesar, he actually resembles that distinguished Roman (look Caesar's bust in the Vatican Museum)on Joker: i assume this figure is based on a representation of an evil, yet funny spirit that was portrayed by Goethe in "Faust". So there should be some German roots of the Joker: Mephistopheles or Mephisto, played brilliantly by Gustav Gruendgens, who painted his face white. There is a film "Faust" from 1960. I suppose, we might take seriously the fact that Heath Ledger kept himself under the lock for a month working on his role. It's obvious now that he did not waste the time. Here i suggest some videos he might have watched during his solitude (at least concerning his make up): Gustav Gruendgens (1960) as Mephistopheles, without black paint around the eyes Cesar Romero (1966) as Joker, without black paint, but with a broad smile Klaus Maria Brandauer (1981) in "Mephisto", with black paint around his eyes Klaus Kinski (1986) in "The Crawlspace", with black paint and with a smile Jack Nichilson (1989) as Joker, without black paint, but with a broad grin on his face Brandon Lee (1994) in "The Crow", with black paint and with a smileHeath Ledger, a perfect Faust of our age, who was always moving on, has left this life far too early. In The Dark Knight he simply did his best, the quality of a genius, who is predestined to do his best at a proper time in a proper place, in reality. Since the Joker ought to be horrifying and funny he made him so. A certain shade which casts this film on a viewer (so many people name it "dark") might be produced also by the psychedelic music (written by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard), which makes every scene with the Joker even creepier. On a certain dizziness caused by watching this film, about which some commentators above have complained: well, yes, i felt dizzy, but i assumed it was a part of the plan.I highly recommend The Dark Knight. Enjoy it!barter2009@web.de"

Perfect!","One of the greatest DC superhero films ever produced if not THE greatest, "The Dark Knight" is the sequel to Batman Begins with many returning cast members, such as, Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman, with a new yet utterly recognisable villain entering the stage; Heath Ledger playing the Joker, giving an absolutely amazing performance as a crazed psychopath. Moral issues are tackled with great cinematography and beautifully performed parts. If an issue was to be addressed, it would be Christian Bale's voice as Batman. Although it can be overlooked due to the minor issue it plays in such a big picture, it is frustrating to hear his deep and croaky voice. Take a Strepsil! "The Dark Knight" somehow surpasses "Batman Begins" and there is next-to-nothing to flaw this film with an exceptional performance from Heath Ledger, making him the most incredible villain to date."

No tension at all, you feel nothing in the movie, some scenes were completely unnecessary, and im sure many people think they like it just because of the fact that it is a different take on Batman and that it is dark and because it has adult themes everyone will like it. I've never seen a movie so bad and boring before, come on people get over it this the best film of all time? How can this garbage be considered one of the best movies of all time? I mean so many random new characters get introduced and then end up serving no purpose to the film, there is no climax, no feel, no obstacles anyone has to overcome.

How long are you going to enjoy being children? This is a movie for kids. It was a movie for kids when I was born. Suddenly the world has changed.

Sign in to vote.,"Unbelievable!","Christopher Nolan's "Batman Begins" brought a much deserved return of the Caped Crusader that the cinema audiences wanted - true to the material and portraying Batman/Bruce Wayne in the fashion that makes this iconic character so fascinating.The sequel "The Dark Knight" delves even deeper and the finished product on the screen is - a masterpiece.The script is outstanding and the action never lets up. Christian Bale proves once again, as Batman, why this series is so good. He brings intensity magnetism and depth to both Bruce Wayne and Batman, and when in the suit, he commands the screen.In this film we find the criminal underworld still fighting for the reins of Gotham City but this time, from out of the smoke of spitting automatic rifles and greasy, unscrupulous mobsters, comes what will prove to be Gotham's true nightmare.Heath Ledger as the Joker is unforgettable - his performance is absolutely mesmerizing - he is hilarious and blood-chilling at the same time - I kept saying to myself - "Its not possible that it is Ledger under that make-up." his performance is one of most impressive I have ever seen on screen. I can't imagine what it was like to be one of the other actors and playing a scene on the same set - all the Joker's scenes are incredible - you can't take your eyes off him.Underneath the primary plot of a story are two determined forces pitted against one another, we are treated to a brilliant illustration of two characters that walk a fine line of being almost the very same product - both created out of some deep-rooted tragic circumstance from a dark past, two tormented souls driven by both power and pain. In the end only one will walk away - but at what cost?The rest of the cast, notably Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman and Aaron Eckhart - all bring symbolic elements to the story - wisdom, loyalty, dedication, honor and justice - coupled with their own individual, personal drives.This film is so well done you forget you are watching a comic book super hero flick - this is one of the best movies I have ever seen."

Sign in to vote.,"Great, but it drags on, and tails off at the end a bit.","Batman: The Dark Knight ****You've heard me say it before, but I'll say it again: Hooray for Mamma Mia! For there was a movie which knew exactly what it was. It knew its genre and its purpose. So many recent movies fail to do this and unfortunately, despite its obvious qualities, "The Dark Knight" is among them. Apart from the apparent irrelevance of the title, (The phrase "Dark Knight" is used twice at maximum, and even then it is difficult to understand why it is being said or who, in fact the Dark Knight actually is,) the film does retain an absolutely intriguing power throughout. The power of a number of stunning performances, (Aaron Eckhart and the late Heath Ledger providing particularly chilling and enjoyable entertainment) blended with a gripping storyline made for a movie with the potential to be a classic. At first glance, the film has everything a modern Hollywood action movie should. A star cast, great action scenes, believable special effects, a female lead who is headstrong and intelligent and at the same time fairly boring, (What is it with these comic book action movies where the lead always has to be a curvy intelligent person with a round face who dresses nicely and says clever stuff but doesn't ever seem to do much; replace Kirsten Dunst in Spiderman with Maggie Gyllenhaal in Batman, can you see the difference?) a superhero and a terrifying bad guy. And I must say, it was a very enjoyable movie but I could not help but feel a little disappointed as I walked out of the cinema. Once again, a film hits the screen which appears to be confused as to quite what genre it is. of course, it is an action thriller, and if it was simply that, then it would have been an utterly fantastic movie, but the main character hinders that slightly. The movie is about Batman. Batman is a character from comic strips. He's a child's hero. And yet the movie is set in a city which is basically New York. (yeah, Gotham City, I know but come on, it's New York, we all know it is) Batman looks so out of place in the beaten up car parks and mean streets of the real modern criminal underworld with his funny ears and his wings it becomes comical; I mean, come on guys, superheroes who base themselves on animals are so 20th century. Look what it did for Toby MacGuire, he struggled to defeat an enemy who was essentially a green version of Gollum on a flying skateboard. My point is that old comic book superheroes in modern setting doesn;t work. Especially when said superhero talks like Chewbacca with a sore throat. Like I said, it's more comical than cool. Another disappointment was the end. Or rather, the lack of it. With the tension built up to bursting point with freaky Heath Ledger on the verge of killing everyone in New York (I mean Gotham City, obviously) and everything in chaos we're expecting a great ending, with the good guys turning it around against all odds. And sure enough, Batman goes and kicks Ledger's arse, but then what? he saves him? Oh,, Batman's too noble to kill in cold blood (some superhero) and The Joker teases him about it, while dangling in the air. So, we're all thinking whats going to happen next? This is amazing! Actually what happens next is that Batman goes and saves Aaron Eckhart from ruining everything he once was and saves a cop's life in the process. Ah, good ol' Batman, we're thinking, now go and kick some Joker arse. And this is where the movie falls apart. Batman doesn't go and deal with the bad guy. He runs away, pretending he was the bad guy, so that Aaron Eckhart's legacy remains untainted. Aaaw how noble, but what about the rest of the story? It was as if the cinema had accidentally turned the movie off five minutes early. It didn;t even seem like you were meant to draw your own conclusion as a viewer, just like the film didn't finish properly. Once again though, I will now totally contradict myself and admit that the movie was very very good, the acting was sublime, the story was gripping and a little tragic (if inconclusive) and I do think it is worth seeing.Best Quote: The Joker: Let's turn the clocks back. A year ago, these cops and lawyers wouldn't dare cross any of you. I mean, what happened? Did your - did your balls drop off? Hmm?Best Bit: The Interrogation Room scene with Batman and The JokerWorst Bit: The very end.Look out for: Christian Bale's ability to drop his balls a bit further every time he wears the batman suit, and to go back to pre-pubescence every time he takes it off."

There has never been another epic or equally eloquent piece of symphonic imagery ever put to celluloid. The death of young Heath Ledger, ripped from his prime by a careless accident, drives the emotion and catharsis for us as we witness the desolation and self-destruction of his Joker on the big screen. It is life imitating art imitating life, and it gives us a reason to cheer for the bad guy, as much as we fear him. We know the tragic end of his dramatic life, and we know there can never be another way to bring his end about - it will be deft, heart-rending, and the journey to it will be a monstrous glimpse of the harsh century we have to cope with... but it will be meaningful. It is, after all, a life to be remembered. This appears to be the case, after the first weekend of The Dark Knight's release, and the film has straddled the top of this website's top 100 film list (beating out The Seventh Seal, Schindler's List, The Godfather, and other brooding commentaries of humanity's dark side),has broken records left and right at the theatre box office, and has generated talks of major awards to be administered posthumously to young Mr.Ledger. But what does it all mean? Are we such a society that we welcome a chance to applaud the dead because their final bow from the stage was a glorious one? Is the destitution of hope, as pictured by the lengths the Dark Knight goes to in order to end the destructive reign of Ledger's Joker, a cause we are willing to pick up and carry forth into that dark night? Are we hoping that the terrorists we face, again embodied by Joker, have some tragic story behind them in order to ease the turmoil, and misunderstandings, we have about their cause and their intent to destroy us? Is destruction a means in itself? More importantly, are we willing to allow this vision of Ledger to be our last? A young, tortured, nightmarish caricature of the original comical figure the Joker was meant to be when he started 60 years ago is the way we will commemorate this unbelievably talented actor's passing? Doesn't he deserve better? He certainly does deserve better, and so do we. We do not deserve the abandonment of our ability to laugh, to welcome destruction as a way of ending destruction, to go solemnly into a dimming world buried by our misunderstanding of one another. We deserve a hero, and we should be cheering for one as well."

It was hyped to be action packed and epic when in the relation to its length there was barely any action. Basically what I am saying is it is no Spider Man 2 which is the Best Comic Book/Super Hero Film EVER, followed closely by X-Men 2. Dark Knight was to humanistic and based in reality, instead of making a grand story they based made it an allegory for current times, which shows good writing and is fine but when i see a comic book movie i want to see something that is magical and has bigger than life action. Dark Knight just wasn't what the advertising made it out to be."

Of course the hero is very cool, but Joker is also interesting character.I like the story of this movie. It is not only the hero's story but also emotional. I was impressed with the scene which Bat man has to choose to help his girl friend or a governor.I watched the movie which Jack Nicholson played joker, but I like Heath Ledger's one.I like the music in this movie,too. I love Hans Zimmer's sound tracks. The music fits the serious mood of this movie."

So many reviewers have already exhausted superlatives when reviewing this picture. Thats understandable, however, as this film is quite simply breathtaking.It's well known that for a sequel to surpass its predecessor is an extremely difficult feat. Take The Matrix for example. Wonderful, ground-breaking blockbuster that spawned two sequels that quite possibly are the worst of all time. Even the great Francis Ford Coppola couldn't produce the magic and mastery that he employed for the Godfather I and II as the third title simply didn't match.However, The Dark Knight, completely defeats Batman Begins, taking nothing away from Batman Begins, it's a truly great film. It was responsible for giving the fading Batman franchise a much needed revamp after the nipple-suits, Uma Thurman and Bane. Bane!? Joel Schumacher...disgrace. Batman Begins packed one hell of an exciting thrill-ride but you can't help but be entranced by the brilliance of The Dark Knight.This film also succeeded in living up to the hype, which is in't exactly bread and butter in the contemporary film industry. Avatar, King Kong? Dark Knight simply delivers. Christopher Nolan has done a great job in portraying Gotham as the crime-riddled, dark and devastating city that it should be. The direction was brilliant, I have become full of admiration for Nolan after seeing Memento and The Prestige and The Dark Knight completes a decade of great work by him.The acting, absolutely glorious! Wonderful ensemble cast, Bale, Ledger, Freeman, Caine, Eckhart, Oldman are all great with a special mention for Ledger as the Joker, one of the greatest motion picture performances of all time. I know it has been said numerous times, but it's true. Even Maggie Gylenhall is acceptable in her role as Rachel, at least she improves on the dreadful turn of Katie Holmes. I have to mention though, Bales voice is inexplicably hoarse and deep, oops! The movie centres on the lunacy of the Joker, as well as the shady dealings of the mafia in the centre of Gotham City and of course, the futile psychotic ploys of Harvey Dent (Eckhart) who transforms into the hideously disfigured Two-Face. For me, despite Batman Forever being a laughable piece of crap, Tommy Lee Jones lived the role of Two-Face quite well where as although Eckhart is good, I find him somewhat inferior his portrayal. This, however, is an excusable shortcoming of the film that certainly does not detract from the films brilliance.The film is also responsible for producing one of the most pulsating endings of all time. Great action and drama with the Joker's insanity-fuelled projects i.e blowing up hospitals and arming two boats full of Gotham civilians and prisoners. All in all, this is a fascinating effort from Nolan and his production team and I look forward to seeing his next film, Inception with Leonardo Di Caprio which is very promising and of course, can't wait to see the third instalment in his Batman franchise which has improved dramatically on Tim Burton's decent double and Joel Schumachers mis-guided, inadequate productions in the 90's. The film thrives on it's great script, some of the finest acting seen in decades and almost flawless direction of Christopher Nolan. Comic book adaptations are a tricky subject. Fantastic Four was miserable and shocking, Daredevil failed to amuse and Superman Returns was barely passable but here we have two wonderful efforts with Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. 10/10. A must-see! Film of the year!"

I thought it felt like I was high in air in the opening scene where they are sliding down the rope. That was the most intense scene for me. So many amazing things happen it is hard to remember them all. Joker shoots a bazooka and hangs his head out a window. Later in the movie he is "hanging upside down" but really he is flying. I was greatly impressed by Heath Ledger's performance as Joker. I like the deep voice Christian Bale does. A lot of people are against this for some reason. He doesn't disguise his voice. Batman shows you what he is capable of. Commissioner Gordon is delightful. I call every movie I like my favorite movie, but it is also my favorite. Enjoy the show."

Having said that, I think Ledger's performance - though fantastic - is overrated. Now, hear me out here ... he's absolutely wonderful and great but Oscar-worthy? C'mon ... if you slapped some makeup and green hair dye onto Lewis Black the movie would have been EXACTLY the same. The best part about the Dark Knight is it will show Marvel Studios how wrong they were to cut out Ed Norton's contributions to Incredible Hulk thinking fanboys wanted more action and less character development. That's the sort of idiotic reasoning I'd expect from George Lucas but, thankfully, Christopher Nolan wouldn't dream of giving us. If Incredible Hulk hadn't cut 40 minutes of dialogue and drama, it wouldn't have sprinted to the second-run dollar cinemas and might have had as an impressive a showing as Dark Knight."

If you don't like Batman don't worry, only the suits, the characters names and the city are from the Batman comic, everything else is totally different. With one of the best villains, and supporting performances ever seen, the Heat Ledger Joker is magnificent, gore and creepy, everything he do is simply epic and referenced everywhere, like the hospital scene or the "why so serious" witch is the modern "offer he can't refuse". I don't say anything about the plot, the directing, the sound and the soundtrack, because I haven't anything today, only PERFECTION. In conclusion if you have never watched this movie you have to watch it now, if you have already watched the movie, watch it back now.

In fact, I just I just watched the movie on IMAX, and I feel compelled to share my experience. First off, watch the movie on IMAX. There are certain scenes that were filmed with the IMAX camera, and the movie shines in these moments. And the transition from IMAX to widescreen is seamless. There are moments during the film when I asked myself why does this scene feel so amazing, and it was because it ate up the entire IMAX screen. That being said, if IMAX isn't an option, see it anyways.I've seen every superhero movie out there. And unequivocally, this is the best of the lot. In fact, this is the best movie I've seen, PERIOD.Is it filled with action? Yes, there are more than a couple of times I was rocked out of my mind. What I saw wasn't digitally done, and that made it all the more awe-inspiring. Chris Nolan rightfully wanted to do the action sequences in live-action, and you the audience benefits from this.Is it filled with emotion? OMG yes. Since Silence of the Lambs have I not felt such chills. There were more than one time during the film when I wanted to look away in fear, but only my desire to see what happened next kept my eyes glued. It is this Two-Faced (sorry, couldn't resist) emotion the movie invokes that differentiates this movie from any prior comic book-inspired movie. The chills are real, the emotions can be tasted, and the scare is to the core. Thank you Heath Ledger. Thank you Christian Bale. Thank You Aaron Eckhart. Thank You Frank Miller (for your original take on Batman, the Dark Knight. And ESPECIALLY, Thank You Chris Nolan. There isn't a performance I would want to change. The movie isn't so dark that it doesn't have its light moments. On more than one occasion, I laughed out loud. Sometimes to exhale all the pent of tension, and other times because the cleverly placed humor surprised me.Is it political? Yes. Is it so pessimistic that it turns off the audience? no. Is it so optimistic that you can't suspend your disbelief? no. Chris Nolan beautifully paints a caricature of society. Like looking at our society in a fun-house mirror. This society is violent and scary, but like that which you see in a fun-house mirror, the image is oddly recognizable...familiar even.I came out of the theater knowing I just watched a masterpiece. A movie that transcends genre. Yes, it's a summer blockbuster. Yes, it's a comic book movie. Yes, it is all those things. But it is so much more than that. It is above all else, a transcendent experience. This movie inspires me to look at society and all that is going on this world.Do yourself a favor, Watch this Movie. Watch it Twice. Watch it Thrice. You won't be disappointed until it end...because all great things do come to an end."

A sequel to the blockbuster Bataman Begins; this movie is even better than its predecessor. The movie deals with the dilemma faced by Bruce Wayne whether Gotham needs the batman anymore or not? With Harvey Dent as the new D.A. he thinks of quitting the robes of batman and try his luck with Rachel. But fate has something else waiting for him as there comes the most "loved" and super-psychotic villain of our time "Joker". Joker takes the center-stage in this movie. He is the back-bone of the movie and makes his presence felt from the very first seen.The ensemble cast is absolutely gorgeous. The screenplay is mind blowing. Christian Bale rocks as Batman. Michael Caine, Gary Oldman,etc. all have done a great piece of work as supporting cast. But Heath Ledger steals the show. He has done a mind boggling portrayal of the Joker. R.I.P Heath."

Well it was better than I expected, it includes tons of action, and suspense. Heath Ledger did an amazing job as the joker, and showed the dark, menacing side of him, and yet still show the fun side of him also. Aaron Eckhart did a great Harvey Dent and an even better Two Face, his origin was different then the comics but I liked that, my only complain about Two Face is that they killed him off too early, he could have been a great villain in the next Batman film. Maggie Gyllenhaal did a good Rachel Dawes, definitely better than Katie Holmes, the only problem with her was that she got a little annoying more int the film. Christan Bale, Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, and Morgan Freeman did equally as great as in Batman Begins unlike everyone else I didn't think Batman's voice got annoying. One other thing I like was how the Joker got Harvey turned into Two-Face so he can show how a person as great as Harvey Dent can turn bad, and how he used logic to do it. Overall great movie, that leaves you on the edge of your seat in suspense. 10/10"

9,19-May-19,ikjones-08629,0,0,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"A Darker Knight","The best Batman film by far. In the comics, Batman is supposed to be a fearless vigilante and the cosmos's best detective. They show off both of those things. The reason I believe that is the best Batman film by far is showing why they call him the best detective in the world. Every Batman film is always presenting - in order - villain, tragedy, loss, encouragement, then a huge fight scene. It showed how Batman uses his wealth and expertise. But this film plays with Batman's rules. Every scene was surprising and intense with all the villains. The Joker was unbelievable.If you are scrolling through these reviews, you'll see so many people say "People just felt bad because he died young so they overreacted by giving him an Academy Award". Ignores those idiots.It's a shame that Ledger died and did young - it's lucky that this is his last performance as in my opinion, it is his best.The Joker was scary, compelling and so unpredictable in every scene. It is dark, chilling and electrifying with the performance of a lifetime given by Heath Ledger. And of course, rest in peace. I loved the realism look to his character instead of the clean makeup and silky green hair, it was smudged paint, knotty hair, scars on his face. Also, the dark humor with the character was so simultaneous and entertaining. Christopher Nolan (unlike most directors) knows how to create a comic book flick. He handles the number of special effects and CGI very strong. Although I was a little weirded out about Two-Face. No, not the scary disturbing way it is supposed to be. In a way that it is bad CGI, not terrible but bad. It looked very slimy and looked as if it was moving all the time. In my opinion, they should've used makeup and possibly used a small amount of CGI for his eye. And his suit looked burnt which made no sense as I'm pretty sure not only would it fully burnt to dust, but I'm sure that the Hospital would've thrown it away.But the way they implemented Two-Face was incredible and Erik Eckhart personality he introduced for Two-Face was great. Christian Bale's acting was not at all bad. But I would say that this was (out of the three movies) his best and worst performance. At scenes, he amazingly showed how Batman wanted to kill Joker but couldn't since he doesn't want anyone to suffer as he did as a kid. But on some scenes, he didn't show anything impressive like he's done previously. Some people might say that this was the best superhero film as it used nearly included no CGI and almost all the explosions were real, it was authentic. I didn't think much of Cillian Murphy in the movie. Everything else was exceptional. If you are a huge Joker fan, watch this."

Why do people like this movie this much? I believe the only reason is the Superhero! I believe People love Superheros. Perhaps because somehow they want to imagine their own world with the existence of these superheros.So if you are a fan of superheros this movie is great in it's kind!

Nolan handles the pacing perfectly and the sound is A+...the moments of silence during the chaos are deafening. The effects are faultless and the dark sets really draw you into the crime riddled world of Gotham city. Eckhart is superb and if it was for Ledger,. would surely of been nominated at well. The ONLY negative is Bale's gruff voice and the fact that the Academy are a bunch of snobs for boycotting the film.Easily Film of Last Year!"

Then I thought, is it because he didn't get one for Brokeback? Or more dubious still...is it because he...died? But...well...how Randy N. Welsh can I put it...?

Seeing recasting was necessary (does Tom have a problem with his wife being involved with Batman? Too many bad memories perhaps? Why am I even talking about such garbage here?) they could have done a butt-load worse than Maggie. She rocks. As does Aaron Eckhart. But I'm not giving ANYTHING away.

Though the movie has a very extended plot which at some points you are capable of zoning out and not miss a thing and would still know whats going on, or you might be woken up by an explosion or by the laugh of the joker creating his chaos. Another characteristic i found delightful was the involvement of Harvey Dent, which in my opinion added some more chaos and enlightenment to the movie. I also enjoyed how the movie started off with an action scene to pull in your attention and to also introduce the joker in an interesting way. On another note, the film definitely did not portray my imagination of the batcave as a child. But all in all,its a classic movie that withholds parts to be hated and parts to be loved."

Asgard in the first two movies looked so grand, and shiny.In this movie, while there's technically more colour, it feels more flat.It's like the cinematographer turned the brightness up to the absolute maximum, and the contrast down to the absolute minimum so instead of the colours standing out, the picture looks mostly white and grey.One of the more stranger things I felt with this movie, is that it feels like the filmmakers hate all the characters, except for maybe Heimdall.Thor and Loki are constantly falling over, getting hit in the head, and getting electrocuted, which in Thor's case doesn't make sense, since he can shoot lightening at the end.Volstagg, Fandral, and Hogun are just killed off in their first scenes, and Thor doesn't even react or find out.Sif isn't even mentioned in this movie.Hela's the villain, so yeah I'm not surprised there.Valkyrie is just an alcoholic who kidnaps people for money, and yeah that's about all there is to her character, yeah the villain killed her wife but at the end when she's fighting Hela, she doesn't say, "That was for my lover" or anything related to that, that little bit of back story just felt pointless.Skurge, he basically has no character, he's just fed info by Hela, turns good again at the end, then dies.Bruce Banner, he's just here so the producers could put The Hulk on all the posters and in all of the trailers, other then that, he doesn't have a character ark, he just falls over a lot, gets hit in the head a bunch, and he says unfunny one liners, basically the same as Thor and Loki.And finally Odin, what really surprised me with this specifically, is how the writers added a bunch of backstory to Odin's character, to just ignore it.Basically Odin and Hela went around conquering and committing genocide on different worlds.You'd think being Odin's son, Thor might have some sort of emotional response to this, but just like with Volstagg, Fandral, and Hogun, he doesn't even find out, so it's just as useless.And last of all here's a question I bet even people who like this movie can't answer, What is the theme/message of this movie?Because I can name the themes/messages for the first two movies just fine.The theme/message for Thor (2011) "Killing people just for disagreeing with you, only creates enemies"The theme/message for Thor The Dark World "Forcing your people to give up their lives for their land is no less brutal then mass genocide"The theme/message for Thor Ragnarok, after weeks of thinking "Forcing people, to do things against their will is fine, as long it's the good guys who are forcing them"It's a shame when a series starts off by simply being, and doing its own thing.But then the producers start listening to the people who weren't even fans to begin with, and they turn it into an obnoxious, cynical, condescending, self parody, that I didn't walk out on, because I still like the MCU."

10,3-Nov-17,harry_tk_yung,3,8,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"Almost a standalone","The general movie audience would have by now been aware, even if vaguely, that this third instalment of Thor is different. The titular character is somewhat different from the one we know. While he keeps insisting that he is the "god of thunder" he comes across more as an everyday comic (as in funny) character. It may be a long shot but it could just be possible that the movie makers have seen Chris Hemsworth in "Ghostbusters" (2016), recognized his talents, and wrote his part accordingly in "Thor: Ragnarok". You can arguably call this a stand-alone movie. It happens mostly in the mythical worlds although there are brief glimpses of Earth.The prologue has Thor suspended in chains, facing the demonic Surtur who swears to bring about Ragnarok (Norse mythology of massive battle resulting in the death of the gods Odin, Thor and Loki, among others) which, for this movie, accents on the total destruction of Asgard, Thor's homeland. With more-than-usual comic quips, a sign of things to come, the call-for-hammer routine plays out, as usual. Next, Thor gets to Asgard, "beam-me-up" fashion, and finds everything changed. For a start, the guardian of the portal who does the beaming is no longer Heimdall (Idris Elba) but a replacement called Skurge (Karl Urban, also known as Eomer or Bones). Most importantly, Odin (Anthony Hopkins) is purportedly on a self-imposed exile while Loki (Tom Hiddleston) seems to be in charge. Skipping some details, the brothers are in Earth next, seeking advice from Dr Strange (a delightful Benedict Cumberbatch). They find Odin in lonely contemplation on a breath-taking coastal cliff. Just as soon as Odin disappears after telling them about their first-born sister Hela (Cate Blanchett), she appears with lofty claims, including The Queen of Death. For the first time, Thor finds himself over-matched (well, maybe not, if you think of The Hulk). Far worse, his iconic hammer is shattered. If you think that there cannot be a Thor without his hammer, think again.From this point, the story forks into parallel narratives. In Asgard, Hela take over, with a lot of killing. Thor finds himself, sans hammer, in a junkyard world called Sakaar, taken first by a bounty hunter Valkarie (an endearing Tessa Thompson) and then handed over to the Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum) who runs a gladiator joint. At the coliseum, overjoyed to find his opponent to be a "friend from work", Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor is soon dismayed when the latter tells him that "there is no Banner; only Hulk". The most enjoyable part of the movie is this sequence on Sakaar, essentially in watching the pair that critics variously liken to Bob Hope/Bing Crosby, Laurel/Hardy and, yes, Abbott Costello. Valkarie finally joins them forming a trio (reminding you of Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman) with the quest of saving their homeland (not Banner's, but he'll help). Meanwhile, back in Asgard Heimdall, stealing the sword of the portal, leads a resurgence. Hela appoints Skurge "Executioner". Big brawl brewing.This movie is rich in funnies. Here are just a few examples. 1. A comment on a three-prong wooden fork as a possible weapon is that "it is only useful against three vampires bundled together". 2. Someone casually calls Loki "lackey". 3. Thor, uncharacteristically cunning, tells Hulk that he does not like Banner, then later tells Banner that he does not like Hulk. There are a lot more of these moments.Hemsworth's somewhat altered persona of Thor is well received by critics and audience alike. Ruffalo must be having a lot of fun perfecting what he does best, accentuating the battle of Hulk vs Banner. Hiddleston seems to be having an easy time with still a considerable share of screen time but playing a much less demanding role of a light(er)-weight side kick, a "god of mischief." Valkarie is a successful newcomer, not the least because of good casting. When a man obviously totally stoned appears on a movie screen, it is usually a bore. But with a woman drunk and stumbling all over the place, as in Thompson's first appearance as Valkarie, there is undeniably a certain charm. When later it is revealed that the taking to alcohol is to drown some painful memories, the heroine has the audience's heart. Valkarie takes on the name of her entire people of Asgard female warriors because she is the only survivor after the massive slaughter by Hela. Thompson ably delivers this engaging character.The demand on Blanchett from this movie would be just a fraction of the Oscar Winning "Blue Jasmine" (2013). I cannot fault her portrayal of pure evil here but personally much prefer Galadriel in the LORT trilogy. Of the other newcomers, Goldblum and Urban carry their roles with sufficient authority, while Cumberbatch is an iconic cameo. Of the regulars, Hopkins and Elba have small parts only, but are good to see. I am also pleased to see Tadanobu Asano reprising Hogun, albeit just brief appearance at the beginning. Oh yes, you will see Scarlett Johansson as Natasha, if you don't blink."

Sign in to vote.,"Good-vibe superhero entertainment","Thor is imprisoned on the other side of the universe and finds himself in a race against time to get back to Asgard to stop the ruthless God Hela.Director Taika Waititi offers more fun than the overlong, padded majority of Marvel films than it should, Thor Ragnarok has plenty of humour (maybe a little too much). From the special effects to costume design and colourful characters including actors Chris Hemsworth, whose Thor goes through a few changes certainly looks wise right up until the end. There's a welcomed on form return of Idris Elba, Tom Hiddleston's sly Loki, Mark Ruffalo, who gets plenty to do with his dazed Banner and there's more Hulk action, with Anthony Hopkins' nonchalant Odin and Benedict Cumberbatch's Doctor Strange who both cameo.New comers to the series evil Cate Blanchett, who is not just a 'end level baddie', Jeff Goldblum as the Grandmaster and Karl Urban give more than the stereotype unsavoury characters, there's also a few twists and turns. Tessa Thompson is also noteworthy and excellent Clancy Brown voices Surtur. Waititi also voices the memorable Korg.There's the obligatory end credit scene, here two of them. Interestingly where as the Led Zeppelin "Immigrant Song" is overused Mark Mothersbaugh's music and the score is fitting to the 80s vibe throughout, sadly Magic Sword's epic tune "In The Face of Evil" appears to be omitted from the feature, only appearing in the trailer. Still Mothersbaugh's music has a similar feel.Overall, Ragnarok's strength lay in its entertainment value, thanks to some relaxed writing, likeable characters and story beats. Highly recommended."

The directing and plot are always top-notch and the story events are linked very well to each other. Marvel movies probably have the best CGI in movie industry and look very well. One of the things which I'm really glad about is that I didn't watch the trailer before watching this movie. If I would watch the trailer then I don't think I would rate this a 9. The Hulk made this movie so much better, I had no idea that Hulk is gonna be in it! What's special about this Thor movie is that it has a lot of humor and jokes and some of them are weird, but it did make it more interesting.I think I didn't give this movie a 10 because some of the jokes were too much and there were some kind of ridiculous things in plot which didn't seem very realistic or were cliches.I didn't really expect this movie to be this good, but I love how Marvel brings all their movies together into one big story. It will be amazing to rewatch them all in like 10 years"

Black Panther is serious, tense and doesn't almost belittle deep moments, and2. If Avengers: Infinity War is Marvel's most darkest and emotional film to date.Reason being, I believe that Marvel took this route with Ragnarok because their next 2 installments will be serious, so they may have wanted to avoid seeming stale by releasing 3 movies in a row that have this "dark" theme to it. Think about it; Ragnarok = light. Black Panther = dark. Infinity War = dark, and Ant-Man and the Wasp = light. Light-dark-dark-light instead of dark-dark-dark-light... That theory to me, makes sense, and if that is the plan, perhaps I can understand... But, if Black Panther and/or Infinity War churn out the same kind of theme as Ragnarok, Marvel, truth be told, will have broken my heart."

In the meantime, he has to race against time to stop an evil force destroying Asgard.Perhaps inspired by the success of "Deadpool", "Thor: Ragnarok" has comedic elements beefed way up. It gets to a point where I think there is too much comedy and not enough heroic demeanor. Fortunately, the balance of comedy and heroic action is successfully struck by the middle of the film. The jokes in the second half of the film induces giggles, but do not distract viewers from the story. The story is intense and the visuals are great. Cate Blanchett is stylish and yet chill inducing in her new look and feel that I have not seen in any of her previous film. I feel a little sad about what happens to the main character, and I wish it did not turn out that way. I enjoyed watching it, even though I wish the superhero elements is emphasised more."

As the third entry in the "Thor" franchise, I anticipated a traditional super-hero movie like the previous two: lots of drama and threat and the occasional humorous one-liner. But this is actually the funniest by far of all the works in the Marvel canon (now 17 films) and has clearly been influenced substantially by the commercial success of the two "Guardians Of The Galaxy" movies which came out in between "Thor: The Dark World" and "Thor: Ragnarok". This makes for an immensely entertaining outing but inevitably dials down the tension. As well as different writers, we have to thank for the new style New Zealand director Taika Waititi who additionally voices the granite character Korg who could have stomped straight out of a "GOTG" film.As always with super-hero movies, we have lots of noise and colour together with splendid sets and effective special effects, but ultimately what makes this movie work is the cast. As well as Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston as brothers Thor and Loki, we have the wonderful Cate Blanchett as their gorgon-like sister Hela, another enjoyable female actress Tessa Thompson as a Valkryie, Mark Ruffalo as the Incredible Hulk, and the delightful Jeff Goldblum as an unlikely- looking villain called simply Grandmaster. The plot is rather confusing (but essentially Ragnarok = the destruction of Asgard) and the humour sometimes juvenile (a cosmic star gate is called "the Devil's Anus"), but the whole thing is such F-U-N.Marvel movies always have a teaser clip at the end and this time we are treated to two: one early in the credits and one at the very end. The humour never stops."

10,1-Nov-17,jdesando,33,61,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"Satisfying muscular myth and light humor.",""Asgard is not a place, it's a people." Odin (Anthony Hopkins) Thor: Ragnarok is about saving a homeland, Asgard, but eventually not the physical land. It's all about the people, a gentle allusion to the plight today of immigrants who have become travelers while bringing home with them. People leaving in a space ship like an ark carry the Biblical heft and a swashbuckling sci-fi adventure.So the redeeming element of these heroic films from Marvel, and DC for that matter, is the cultural mash up that reflects our civilization's abiding interest in how we can become better than we are, i.e., becoming super heroes, and yet retain the sweet, flawed humanity we were meant to be. The pervasive humor in quips and self deprecation is a welcome humane ingredient and a sign that the super hero genre is maturing.In Thor :Ragnorak, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is not just a hemmer-throwing, muscle bound cutie; he is a young man dealing with the death of his father, Odin; the mischief of his brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston); and the devastating power of his sister, Hela (Cate Blanchett), the goddess of death. A bit more severe than yours and my families, but in a figurative way, just the same with its challenging relationships that sometime seem bloody.Although these space citizens are years ahead of us, they still fight with broadswords and machine guns, confirming our cultural awareness that battles will never really be different because they reside in the mind. From Greeks through now, we have been fascinated by our highs and lows, our greatness and our flaws, be it in Oedipus Rex or Willy Lowman.There will always be a place for hubris in our theater and films, and although the time and technology may differ, we still love and deplore our bloodlines as we work our way to dusty death. This Thor carries too many explosions for my taste, but the sociological thunderstorms are satisfyingly entertaining and sometimes downright allegorical."

10,25-Oct-17,shawneofthedead,66,124,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"Get ready to Ragnarok & Roll - this film is the most fun you'll have in a cinema all year!","In some alternate reality, a movie bearing the title of Thor: Ragnarok has taken itself very seriously indeed: full of literal doom and gloom, it's an apocalyptic drama about the End of Days, as prophesied by Norse mythology. Since that pretty much describes the world in which we currently live, it's actually rather fitting that Marvel's 17th studio film is something else entirely. In our reality, Thor: Ragnarok is a wild, wacky and very welcome blast of pure joy - a raucous comedy that fuses an intergalactic road trip with buddy comedy, brotherly rivalry and battle domes. Thank Thor (and director Taika Waititi) for that!We reunite with Thor (Hemsworth) - still free of new Infinity Stones, freshly confident that he's once again warded off the fabled Ragnarok - just as he discovers that something is rotten in the state of Asgard. As teased at the end of Thor: The Dark World, Loki (Hiddleston), his shape-shifting trickster brother, has been impersonating their ailing dad, Odin (Hopkins). When Odin's strength finally fails, the dark secret he's been keeping at bay storms into the lives of his sons: Hela (Blanchett), their bloodthirsty older sister, is back to claim the throne she believes is rightfully hers.For (largely) better or (occasionally) worse, Thor: Ragnarok doesn't dwell as much on the royal family drama as its predecessors did. Instead, its second act plays out on the candy-coated, death-dealing planet of Sakaar. Ruled by the whims and fancies of the Grandmaster (Goldblum dialled to 11), Sakaar's people are relentlessly entertained in their very own battle dome. (Think the gladiatorial contests of ancient Rome, with holographic screens and super-powered alien beings.) Following an initial devastating confrontation with Hela, Thor is stranded on Sakaar, and brought in by the mercenary Valkyrie (Thompson) to stand against the raging primal force of the Hulk (Ruffalo) - not quite the "friend from work" Thor remembers. If that all sounds like serious business, rest assured it's very much not. There's a gentle wit threaded through every frame of this film - a glorious, big-hearted silliness that fans of Taika Waititi will remember (and treasure) from such indie comedy gems as What We Did In The Shadows and Hunt For The Wilderpeople. Miraculously, Waititi has managed to infuse this gargantuan, green-screened epic with his trademark offbeat vibe, best exemplified in the way key plot points are revealed (via sardonic monologue or ironic stage play) and the character he plays (Korg, a chirpy rock monster who befriends Thor before our hero heads into the arena). Waititi's involvement is a blessing for pretty much everyone involved in the film, but especially for Hemsworth. It's not that he hasn't been good in his previous appearances as the God of Thunder throughout the franchise - he was suavely charming in Thor and resolutely grim in The Dark World. But he's so remarkably good here, switching effortlessly between bright-eyed puppy and care-worn leader, that it feels like he's finally come home. Hemsworth's performance in this film is a fantastic balance of sunshine, silliness and subversiveness, and it's a joy to behold.It's clear, too, that everyone in the cast - including respected veterans like Hopkins and Blanchett - were delighted to partake in the film's mirth and mayhem. Ruffalo continues to play the dual aspects of Bruce Banner - looming brute and mild-mannered professor - with so much winning charm that you want him to get his own Hulk movie, stat. Hiddleston is totally game for playing up the odd- couple comedy of Loki's rivalry with Thor, while shading unexpected complexity into his character's machinations. Thompson swaggers off with practically every scene she's in, finding the heart, humour and heroism in an Asgardian warrior who's lost her way. Perhaps more impressively, Waititi handles every Marvel blockbuster's requisite action scenes with more clarity and flair than you'd expect from an indie director. He manages to find character and comedy beats even in swooping spaceship chases and bruising hand-to-hand combat. There's a thrilling fluidity to the action sequences - whether it's Thor soaring towards his enemies like lightning made flesh, or Hela unleashing her multiple projectiles of death with a dark, graceful beauty.That's not to say Thor: Ragnarok is perfect. As it turns out, the film's greatest strength - apocalypse as afterthought - is also its biggest flaw. Waititi just about manages to find the emotional weight in Thor coming to terms with his power and leadership (a driving theme for this character), but it does get a little lost in all the knockabout comedy. Thanks to Blanchett, Hela is never less than terrifying: she oozes gleeful malevolence in her wake, forcing Thor to confront his own gold-tinted ideas of himself, his family and his history. Alas, she's also one of that peculiar breed of antagonist who's immeasurably powerful and strangely ineffective, all at the same time. For years, Marvel has been making brave choices in terms of the directors to whom it has entrusted its stories and characters. This strategy has yielded films that are, for the most part, creatively diverse, ranging in quality from decent to excellent. Even so, handing the reins of the Thor franchise to a director with such a unique voice as Waititi might have been its biggest gamble yet. Fortunately, it pays off in spades. Smart, silly and self-aware, Thor: Ragnarok is a blockbuster that feels like it snuck into cinemas by way of the art-house. It's also that rare threequel which isn't just as good as its predecessors - it's easily the best of the lot."

Despite enjoying Spider-Man Homecoming a little more overall, partially because there were things I didn't like about Thor Ragnarok but there was very little I disliked about Homecoming, all in all, this film is really, really good. It's explosive and fun and colorful and enjoyable and looks terrific and exquisite all throughout. Is it overdone? You decide whether or not they overdid some things for this one. I see lots of people comparing it to Guardians of the Galaxy and while I don't fully agree, I can definitely say that there are some things that are reminiscent of the Guardians' movies, but certainly not in a bad way.What makes this film so good is its associates. They're not out of place and they're not really forced in; like, it fits perfectly, man. Everything comes together so nicely. Take Hulk for example. I was thinking, "Hulk may or may not work in this film. Could be great, could be straight out opposite." Well, overall, I think it's a good idea that they did include Hulk - even more so when they had him appear as Bruce, rather than Hulk himself. Mark Ruffalo's Hulk is by far the best one yet. Well, to me at least. Another thing I have to include is its humor. Some say it's either a little forced or it's just simply not all that funny. Well, the moments that were funny, were funny. Not much more can be said other than the fact that yeah, some stuff had me like, "Ehh.. okay", but for the most part, there's some solid laughs here and there.Jeff Goldblum's role was unique, to say the least - but did kind of remind me of The Collector from Guardians of the Galaxy. I don't know, he just did. Not a bad thing, but you know. If I were to comment on his character, I would have to say he's pretty good. He's not amazing, but he's an interesting part of the film and makes an okay villain (assuming you would call him that). One thing that really stood out to me and made the film even more enjoyable was its brother scenes, aka, scenes that revolve around Loki and Thor together. That was good in this film. I actually enjoyed Loki in this more than I did The Avengers. And Hemsworth is superb in the film. Not a better guy out there that could have played Thor. He was the correct, undeniable greatest choice.There's also a very good 'cameo' like role, if you will, which does add to the movie. The film also doesn't lose its identity, meaning that even though there are other characters and whatnot, it's first and foremost a Thor film.Here's what I didn't like (or, who I didn't like, for that matter): Hela. My reasons for disliking her character are pretty much simplistic and generic, but they're not invalid by any means- she's annoying. She's boring. That's really all I can say. I mean, there's a scene in which I do love that includes her, but it's spoiler-ish, so maybe another time...Overall, however, a great film. Bright, colorful, funny, loads of action, good character usage, and the third act is damn good! I think this is perhaps my sixth favorite MCU film overall, overtaking Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, but it is still right behind: 5- Spider-Man Homecoming, 4-The Avengers, 3-Captain America The Winter Soldier, 2-Guardians of the Galaxy and 1-Captain America Civil War. Ragnarok is a terrific film though, and it's one of this year's best.8.5/10"

So now its time for us to see what they have been up to in the meantime. New Zealand indie director Taika Waititi (What We Do in the Shadows) works with a budget for the first time to bring us the third entry in the Thor series that looks and feels more like a Guardians of the Galaxy film in many ways. We have a film set mostly in space and other planets with colorful and goofy characters everywhere and jokes inserted into every scene... but unlike Guardians and the other better MCU films.. this one lacks any emotional resonance.The story telling is a bit of a jumbled mess but tries to blow through plot points so fast that you might not notice. The action scenes are effects heavy but lack excitement, stakes or tension. Despite its many shortcomings though it is fast enough and funny enough to entertain throughout. The highlights for me were Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner and the director himself as a humorous side character names Korg. Hemsworth was great as always as Thor and Tessa Thompson did not disappoint as Valkyrie.The new thing that I noticed atmosphere wise was a much more interesting score than the traditional MCU films have had with a mostly Synth' based score composed by Mark Mothersbaugh (The Lego Movie), who is an unusual choice for score but it paid dividends. In the end the film is not a great film, nor a bad film but an inconsequential yet funny film.5.5/10"

Like I said before, I find the Thor franchise to be the weakest MCU series, so reinventing the character is a smart idea. But the way that Waititi transforms him, and to what extent, really took me out of the movie. Thor is a bumbling moron in this film. He is not in the least bit competent. He's always cracking jokes, or tripping over something. It's slapstick comedy for a character who had previously been established as being a rather serious person with bits of comedy. But this was all comedy, to the point where it felt like an SNL parody sketch rather than a genuine movie. I did not believe for a second that Thor was capable of doing anything, because they made him out to be such an idiot. I appreciate them trying to adjust the character, but it felt more like an elseworld, Taika Waititi fan film than an actual Thor movie..."

We get Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston as well as Jeff Goldblum (in a better role than Independence Day: Resurgence) and lots of colorful sets and powerful effects. The director did a fine job with this film and it's good for a trilogy-closer. I wasn't bored in the slightest. To be honest, I liked this better than The Dark World (Thor's second outing). It's more memorable too."

I'm convinced that this project was written and directed by toddlers. The cringe factor of the dialogue alone is off the charts. The action is good but the FX are decidedly not. It could have been SO good but it's a bad, bad movie. So glad I didn't shell out to see this in a theater."

They've finally figured out how to make one that's not so boring. Every scene is a setup for the next punchline it makes it bit more fun but it also makes it forgettable. I'm not really huge on the comedy, except for Taika's character, he's actually pretty funny and only funny because he's a kiwi and yes sometimes the jokes are overdone. Not much has changed story wise, it's still the same thing about family feud and revenge and other boring things. Not a fan and never a fan of the big CGI fight, they're dull and tedious. On the big picture though, this movie is a step in the right direction."

Sign in to vote.,"A little too polished, but very entertaining and fun","This was the second Marvel film I watched this week (Homecoming being the other), and it reinforced what the franchise does well - which is to entertain. Not all the films achieve this, but Thor Ragnarok certainly does. It takes its lead very much from the stylish and retro fun of Guardians of the Galaxy, but it has an awkward humor that is very much its own. This is really its main selling point, as the film displays great comic timing throughout, with plenty of very good moments drawing good laughs and fun.At times the film feels a bit too engineered and designed. It is such a change from the previous Thor films (which didn't embrace this silliness quite as much) that it does stand out for its difference, but yet at the same time the accessible entertainment value makes it fit very well beside the more recent Marvel films, in particular the comedy tone of Guardians of the Galaxy. This carries it well, and it does own it surprisingly well; it helps that the cast all get it throughout, there is no feeling of everyone working in one direction while a different direction was trying to be found. The silly tone works, while not detracting from the general plot, which is a frame at best, but yet works.The times it tries to have weight don't really manage to stand up, but otherwise there is a lot to like in a film that is entertaining, slick, well timed, and with everyone aligned to what it is trying to do."

The whole movie simply is all form and little substance murdering its comic book background as well as its Norse mythology origin story. Thor now is completely written into a corner. He's a goof bumbling about in a movie written as a comic relief....but a comic relief from what exactly? Sure, the movie looks great but in an attempt to write the whole plot as lighthearted it just turns out emotionally shallow. There is just ONE scene (the elevator scene) during which we get to see two main characters as more than walking punchlines. All that leaves us with a slightly above average adventure story."

Critic reception is through the roof and some talk of it being a pure comedy tuned out to be grossly exaggerated. First and foremost the film has a proper amount of gravitas. It's not overtly "jokey" Scenes and actions have real weight. Thor and Loki both have great character arcs and both characters are fleshed out quite well. The very beginning did give me pause. I feared that the early tone and rather light handling of epic characters from the books would make me hate this film. How Surtur, Skurge, Volstagg and Fandril are handled in the first 15 minutes frankly ticked me off. Even Loki seemed off at first. Yet, as the film unfolded most everything fell in to place nicely and everything seemed to fit the movie perfectly.The action and the visuals are as amazing as advertised. Even Valkyrie worked as a character even though I was not sold on the casting choice. She could easily be any Valkyrie and not the specific one from the books. This third effort puts a wonderful bow on the trilogy with healthy nods to the previous two films. Yet, this certainly stands on its own and is very unique. Hela is a superb villain and this is the best Hemsworth has ever been. Allowed to settle after a stumbling start, this movie was a joy to experience and a blast to watch."

I had never seen the first two Thor films and, according to the general consensus, I had not actually missed much. What was great about this is that I absolutely did not have to watch the first two films to get where the characters were at. It almost seemed like the filmmaker wants to erase what had been in the past and start from scratch, and luckily they did a mighty fine job of it. This is funny and wickedly entertaining, and most importantly, Thor is a great character to watch. Chris Hemsworth infuses him with so much natural charisma that the entire thing works. He has always seemed like he would make a great character, and here he finally becomes one."

It is yet another action movie that gives the powered subwoofer a great workout.In Norse mythology, Ragnarök is a series of future events, including a great battle, foretold to ultimately result in the death of a number of major figures the occurrence of various natural disasters, and the subsequent submersion of the world in water.The IMDb summary does a good job so I won't repeat any of in in this short review. What I like most about this movie is the entertainment value. As viewers we know this is all fantasy, a movie like this should not take itself too seriously. This one is funny and absurd at times within its fictional universe. Even Stan Lee, with his usual 'cameo', actually plays a character that gives Thor an unwanted haircut. There is even an uncredited 'cameo' by Matt Damon, playing the part of Loki in a stage play being presented to Odin.A movie like this must use lots of CG and most of it looks really good. Good, entertaining movie. But who is Taylor Hemsworth who has a very short appearance as the Earth girl who wants to take a selfie with Thor?"

The first two installments are complete garbage. This third episode is improved, but in a very limited way. More concretely, the screenplay is added with more adventure and humor, but the plot as a whole is too scattered and unfocused. Particularly, the gladiator part is unnecessarily too long.

Despite a familiar setup, this silly and bombastic sequel completely veers from the style and tone established by its predecessors and features some exciting action scenes, unique new characters, laugh-out loud humor, and enough references to remind audiences that despite the absurdly in-joke tone of the film that it still is—in fact—a part of the larger Marvel Universe. Hemsworth looks to be having more fun here than in any other of his previous outings as the hero, and both Blanchett and Goldblum have a whale of a time in their colorful supporting roles.

10,8-Dec-17,DHWaldron,0,2,Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.,"Monstrous development of both characters and industry","Taika Waititi was assigned to the role of director for the new Thor film following the success of his comedy Hunt for the Wilderpeople. Thor continues from the success of the previous Avengers films as well as the previous two Thor films, obvious from the various references present, but not completely necessary in the enjoyment-factor. Waititi, given the reins of one of the most anticipated films of the year, declared that, he would add comedy in this new installation, with Waititi himself voicing the funniest character of the film, Korg, a stone-skinned humanoid. Waititi's vision was brought to fruition through the triplet of writer's who successfully employed a range of comedy rarely endeavoured in superhero films.Starring in the satisfying, unconvoluted plot, is Chris Hemsworth continuing his role of Thor accompanied by a new makeover and a monstrous power. With a guest appearance from Mark Ruffalo, continuing as Hulk, the film had everything going for it; it was promising. This regularly comedic script was, despite it's strengths, boring and sluggish for the first quarter, but revives itself quickly, and in parts, completely captures one's interest. With great acting from Chris Hemsworth, the Hulk felt overused in (a particular section of) the film and, in some Bruce Banner rather than Hulk sections, Mark Ruffalo's performance was not up to scratch. The films also possessed annoying and cliché "tough-girls" in Tessa Thompson's 'Valkyrie' and Cate Blanchett's 'Hela', the antagonist of the film.The script also undertakes extravagant, exaggerated battle sequences which, most of the time, aren't interesting (basically, any without Thor - bias?). But, Korg (the comedic rock-man) helps to lift the film as does the highly satisfying final battle and Thor's monstrous development."

Sign in to vote.,"This film was pure gold(blum)","It is one of those marvellous films that place no strain on your focus because it is relentlessly entertaining. It still looks very much like a marvel film but has somehow managed to achieve a superb balance of combining the dry humoured, quirky identity of a smaller Waititi film with the large marvel proportions. There seemed to be a different comedic set up in each scene almost like a sketch show and in general the film felt almost more like a comedy then an action film in terms of genre. It was really great to see Chris Hemsworth showing his skills as a comedy actor and it wasn't just down to the moments of genius within the written dialogue as Hemsworth shows he has a really funny instinct and great use of physical humour. A great quality of the film too was how meta and self deprecating the characters where and it gave the villains in particular more depth. This was particularly in the case of 'Hella' (Cate Blanchett). Hellas darkness and power are presented alongside moments that ridicule her failed attempts to demand respect. The film also uses its special effects in a spectacularly creative ways. When Hellas Hair turns to horns it is a beautifully fluid action that for some reason caused certain people in the screen I was in to exclaim "GO KATE" I don't think they necessarily thought it was the actress's personal skill, but I understand the sentiment. her whole performance was great! there is something about her which really commands your full focus whenever she is on screen. My only criticism would be I would have liked to have seen more Blanchet. I also really felt with this film that the SciFi moments where constructed with great tangibility. Everything in this film looked touchable and correctly weighted which is rare for a glossary high CGI Blockbuster. There is a visually interesting scene taking place in a festival for the Hulk and everything looked like a real life spectacle and yet had the convincing feel of a far away planet. I think what Waititi proves with this film is that he is very accomplished as an action director as well as with comedy as he uses the action sequences to showcase his creative ingenuity. In a flash back scene the texture of the action is that of an old dramatic oil painting in which a fight involving the Valkyries is taking place. The dramatic lighting design in this scene beautifully impressive. Whether a marvel nerd a Waititi fan a comedy snob or just someone who needs escaping into another world for a few hours; this film is well worth the watch!"

They had the right mix of humor and serious plot with well-timed jokes and excellent character development- something this film was severely lacking. Thor seemed to have regressed back to the Thor from the beginning of the first movie, when he was even the focus. Despite being the title character it felt like the main character of the movie was anybody but Thor. Hulk in particular got a lot of focus in the Planet Hulk portion of the movie, which really should have been its own movie rather than taking over Thor. vent though this film was the longest of the three Thor films it was so packed full of unnecessary filler that the parts of the movie that were actually important get glossed over, happening in the blink of an eye to move on to more lengthy filler nonsense. In addition to Thor, Loki was also very poorly written. The god of mischief and lies shouldn't be predictable. Tom Hiddleston is an amazing actor but even he can't save this movie from its bad writing. It felt like the writers had no idea how to write the characters so they just recycled what they saw in the previous movies.Worse yet, this whole movie was overrun with bad humor, as though they had tried to shoehorn in as many jokes as humanly possible in the two hour run time. For the "What was Thor doing during Civil War?" short the humor worked and made me laugh but for a movie with so much death about the destruction of Asgard and the end of Asgardian civilization as we know it it should be far more serious. All the humor does is downplay the gravity of the situation and the "comedic timing" was such that serious situations got turned into jokes and ruined the whole moment. It got to a point where any joke made me cringed or groan in exasperation.I went to Deadpool to see Deadpool. I didn't go to Thor to see Deadpool, but that's what I got and while Deadpool was great Thor Ragnarok was a complete dumpster fire."

Hela is, in the actual Norse legends, the goddess of the underworld/hell NOT the goddess of death. Why is there this completely imbecilic idea to just ignore the actual Norse myths and rewrite it to fit some personal identity fem-autistic ideology PC crap when there is an actual character to base it on? In the underworld she is almost unbeatable but outside of it she is a bit on the weak side. That Hela is remade into a fem-autistic character that's is grossly and erroneously overly powered and completely different from the actual legends is just another pathetic and quite annoying act of Hollywood making up a pile of crap so they can pat themselves on the back. She was only strong when she drew her power from the realm of the underworld. This politically correct fem-autistic BS is ruining so much that would have been so good except for the inclusion of the moronic fem-autistic ideology. She breaks Thor's hammer Mjolinir? Really? Geez this is just another fem-autistic crap dance that their PC BS is imposing. Thor's hammer was forged from the core of a neutron star the strongest and hardest substance in the universe which is not possible to break. Odin couldn't have done it and Hela can? Yeah, right. Another thing Hela is NOT Odin's daughter but in fact from the actual myths she's Loki's daughter. Then there's the error of what Ragnarok is. It's not the end of Asgard it's the end of EVERYTHING. Armageddon. The gods and all people, animals, plants ALL life. All planets and stars will be consumed by Fenrir, the monster wolf, after he defeats Odin and kills him. With such a rich story already written why the hell was there a need to substitute with such a load fem-auti$tic PC crap and bullshit that contradicts it in every way. Another thing... Valkyrie is not a name it's the designation for the maiden guardians of Valhalla that rode winged horses who guided the honored dead to it's gates. They're not even Asgardian actually but created beings to perform a task which was protect the gates and entrance as the guardians to Valhalla and guide the honored dead to them."

After two mediocre Thor movies presenting nothing but the bad side of Marvel films, Ragnarok would've been useless if it weren't so good. I expected it to be a terrible, overhyped and boring comedy. To my surprise, I was wrong.Firstly, all three acts are quite strong. The first act not only shows the new state of the MCU in Phase Three, but also presents the main villain- Hela. Cate Blanchett's performance was quite good, to be honest. The second and third acts were also well made. Even though the villain is introduced quite quickly and there is no real tension or plot twists, the movie still holds strong.Secondly, there is also a clear goal and a clear process to achieving that goal. The characters always strive to achieve that goal (except for Loki), and the villain always strives to achieve hers. Each character actually cares about the goal and don't let the comedy take over the main plot (as seen in Love and Thunder). Sure, there is some comedy, but it isn't prominent enough to turn a gritty, dark movie about war into another "The Office" remake. This movie keeps it's balance between funny and serious, unlike Love and Thunder.Thirdly, the movie is thoroughly enjoyable. The problem with The Dark World was that there wasn't a lot of fun. It was always boring, mediocre and too dark to see anything at all. I really didn't like how they tried to change the tone of the movie to something darker at the cost of it's entertainment value.In conclusion, Ragnarok is the best Thor movie in the entire franchise. Forget about Thor (2011) and don't mind watching Thor: The Dark World (2013). This movie is the best out of the franchise and the only one you should watch. At least, until Thor 4 is on Disney+."

Why, when he was running across the causeway to the castle, didn't he decide to go by scooter instead. Not like he could run fast and hunched up on a scooter heading for the castle, would have been comedy gold"

The other action sequences weren't as good as other's such as Civil War, or Winter Soldier, but made up for it with an easy to follow story, and a divisive plot that will have you wondering what may happen next. This movie was not given a 10/10 due to the fact that some parts weren't as "good" as some, being in the first 20 minutes of the movie, but picked up the pace with it's humor and story, as well as Taika Waititi's character, who is one of my favorite characters in the movie."

Thor : Ragnarok is possible the greatest re-invention of a character in the history of movies. This is pure, unadulterated fun! It's funny, heartwarming and contains a couple of HUGE developments for the future of the MCU. All hail Taika, the real hero!"
